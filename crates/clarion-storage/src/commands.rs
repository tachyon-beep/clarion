//! Writer-actor command protocol (L3 lock-in).
//!
//! Per ADR-011, every persistent mutation is a `WriterCmd` variant. The
//! writer task owns the sole `rusqlite::Connection`; callers enqueue
//! commands via a bounded `mpsc::Sender<WriterCmd>`. Each variant carries
//! a `oneshot::Sender` for the per-command ack (UQ-WP1-03 resolution).
//!
//! Sprint 1 shipped four variants: `BeginRun`, `InsertEntity`, `CommitRun`,
//! `FailRun`. B.3 adds `InsertEdge` (ADR-026). Later WPs add `InsertFinding`,
//! etc. by appending variants — the pattern is frozen here.
