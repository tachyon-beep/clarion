//! Writer-actor implementation (L3 lock-in) per ADR-011.
//!
//! The actor owns the sole write `rusqlite::Connection`. Callers submit
//! commands via `Writer::sender()`. The actor loop pulls one command at a
//! time, applies the mutation inside an implicit transaction bound to the
//! current run, and commits every `batch_size` entity inserts (the
//! "per-N-files" transaction pattern, default N=50 per ADR-011).
//!
//! UQ-WP1-03 resolution: the `commits_observed` [`std::sync::Arc`]`<`[`std::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize`]`>` is
//! incremented on every `COMMIT` issued by the actor. Tests read it to
//! verify batch-boundary commits fire at the expected cadence. It is
//! present in release builds as a no-op counter; no `#[cfg(test)]` gating
//! is used.
