//! Read-only connection pool wrapping `deadpool-sqlite` per ADR-011.
//!
//! Readers take a connection from the pool, run a query, and drop it. The
//! pool caps concurrent connections (default 16 per ADR-011 §Reader pool).
//! WAL mode lets readers see the committed snapshot at the moment they
//! open; writes become visible only after the next checkpoint or a fresh
//! connection.
