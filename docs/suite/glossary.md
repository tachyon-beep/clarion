# Loom suite glossary

**Audience**: anyone designing or reviewing a cross-product-visible field name, ADR, or wire-shape change in any Loom product
**Purpose**: a single read-only catalogue of terms whose meaning crosses product boundaries, so the same word never silently means two things in the federation
**Companion**: [loom.md](./loom.md) for the federation axiom this glossary defends

---

## How to use this glossary

This file is a **design-review artifact**, not infrastructure. Nothing imports it, nothing runs from it, and removing it changes no product's semantics — it is the same shape as `loom.md` itself. Per `loom.md` §5, this means the glossary is federation-safe: it does not introduce semantic coupling, initialization coupling, or pipeline coupling between siblings.

**Consult this glossary when**:

- Authoring an ADR that introduces or renames a cross-product-visible field name
- Reviewing a wire-format change that adds a new top-level key
- Onboarding to a Loom product after working on another, to surface vocabulary surprises
- Triaging a bug whose framing depends on what a word means (the trigger that produced this glossary was exactly such a triage — see [skeleton-audit](../superpowers/handoffs/2026-05-03-skeleton-audit.md))

**Update this glossary when**:

- An ADR moves a term from `open` to `managed` (note the ADR ID in the Authority column)
- A new cross-product term is introduced (add a row before the ADR is Accepted; see ADR-acceptance rule below)
- A term retires from cross-product visibility (mark `retired` with the retirement ADR ID, do not delete)

**Do not** add CI lint, repo gate, or runtime check that consumes this file. Per `loom.md` §5, that would convert a federation-safe doc into shared infrastructure. The glossary is consulted by humans during design review; that is its only job.

## ADR-acceptance rule

ADRs introducing cross-product-visible field names must update this glossary before moving from Proposed to Accepted, with one of three explicit verdicts:

- **`no clash`** — the term is unique to this product, no sibling currently uses it
- **`managed clash`** — a sibling uses the same term; an explicit mapping table exists in the ADR (model: ADR-017's severity vocabulary table with `metadata.clarion.internal_severity` round-trip slot)
- **`renamed`** — the proposed term clashed with a sibling; this ADR renames the local term to avoid the clash

A vocabulary verdict is part of ADR-acceptance evidence, not a courtesy. Three of Clarion v0.1's clashes (`severity`, `rule_id`, `finding` wire shape) got managing ADRs at design time and shipped clean. Three did not (`priority`, `critical`, `source`) and required retrofit. This rule converts the next clash from "discovered during implementation" to "blocked at design review."

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `managed` | Same term used by ≥2 products; an Accepted ADR provides explicit mapping or namespacing |
| `open` | Same term used by ≥2 products; **no managing ADR yet** — clash is live |
| `no clash (informational)` | Term is unique to one product but listed here to head off cross-product reader confusion |
| `deferred` | Clash exists; retirement condition documented; tracked elsewhere |
| `retired` | Was a clash; retiring ADR named; kept as historical record |

## Cross-product terms

### Managed clashes

| Term | Products | Semantics by product | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| `severity` | Clarion ↔ Filigree | Clarion internal: `INFO\|WARN\|ERROR\|CRITICAL` for defects, `NONE` for facts. Filigree wire: `critical\|high\|medium\|low\|info` (lowercase). | [ADR-017](../clarion/adr/ADR-017-severity-and-dedup.md) — explicit mapping table; `metadata.clarion.internal_severity` round-trip slot |
| `rule_id` | Clarion + Wardline → Filigree | Namespaced prefix per emitter: `CLA-PY-*`, `CLA-INFRA-*`, `CLA-FACT-*`, `CLA-SEC-*`, `WLN-*`. Filigree stores byte-for-byte; round-trip preserved. | [ADR-017](../clarion/adr/ADR-017-severity-and-dedup.md), [ADR-022](../clarion/adr/ADR-022-core-plugin-ontology.md) — namespacing convention + grammar enforcement at the Clarion-plugin boundary |
| `finding` (wire shape) | Clarion + Wardline → Filigree | Cross-product unified record type. Field ownership documented; extension via `metadata` slot (top-level keys outside the enumerated set are silently dropped). | [ADR-004](../clarion/adr/ADR-004-finding-exchange-format.md) — full wire schema with explicit ownership |

### Open clashes (resolved by ADR-024 — see [skeleton-audit](../superpowers/handoffs/2026-05-03-skeleton-audit.md))

| Term | Products | Clash | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| `priority` | Clarion ↔ Filigree | Clarion: guidance scope-of-applicability, six-level string enum (`project\|subsystem\|package\|module\|class\|function`). Filigree: issue urgency, numeric `P0..P4`. Same word, unrelated meanings. | **Open** — to be resolved by ADR-024 (rename Clarion's field to `scope_level`/`scope_rank`) |
| `critical` | Clarion ↔ Filigree | Clarion: guidance flag meaning "do not drop under token-budget pressure". Filigree: P0 priority + `severity:critical` tier (highest urgency). Related-but-distinct semantics. | **Open** — to be resolved by ADR-024 (rename Clarion's field to `pinned`) |
| `source` | Within-Clarion + Clarion ↔ Filigree | Clarion overloads the word three ways: `entity.source` = `SourceRange { file_id, byte_start, ... }`; `finding.source` = `{ tool, tool_version, run_id }`; `guidance.source` = `"manual"\|"wardline_derived"\|"filigree_promotion"`. Filigree: `source:` label = `scanner\|review\|agent` (how an issue was discovered). | **Open** — to be resolved by ADR-024 (rename `finding.source` and `guidance.source` to `provenance`; keep `entity.source` since the type `SourceRange` disambiguates) |

### No-clash informational entries

| Term | Owning product | Note for cross-product readers |
|---|---|---|
| `tags` (Clarion) vs `labels` (Filigree) | both | Different word, similar concept. Clarion's `tags` are free-form (plugin/LLM-emitted); Filigree's `labels` are a curated namespaced taxonomy (`area:`, `cluster:`, `effort:`, `priority:`, …). The names accurately reflect the design difference. No rename. |
| `kind` | Clarion (three uses) | Used three ways within Clarion: `entity.kind` (entity taxonomy), `edge.kind` (edge taxonomy), `finding.kind` (`defect\|fact\|classification\|metric\|suggestion`). Disambiguated by struct context; the type carries the namespace. Filigree uses `type` for the analogous concept on issues. |
| `status` | Clarion + Filigree | Distinct state machines on distinct objects: Clarion `runs.status`, Clarion `findings.status` (`open\|acknowledged\|suppressed\|promoted_to_issue` per `detailed-design.md` §6.5; Filigree-side mapping in `detailed-design.md` §7), Filigree per-type issue state machines (`bug` has `triage→confirmed→fixing→...`). Always disambiguated by table or struct. |
| `entity` | Clarion | Clarion code object (function, class, module, guidance, file, subsystem). Other products do not use this term. |
| `subsystem` | Clarion | Cluster of entities produced by Phase 3 clustering. Clarion-only. |
| `briefing` | Clarion | Structured per-entity summary served to consult-mode agents. Clarion-only. |
| `guidance sheet` | Clarion | Institutional knowledge attached to an entity. Clarion-only. |
| `observation` | Filigree | Fire-and-forget agent note that expires after 14 days. Filigree-only. (Note: Clarion `clarion-` prefixed issue IDs may surface in observations, but `observation` as a record type is Filigree-owned.) |
| `finding` (record vs. wire) | Clarion + Wardline (record); Filigree (wire) | Clarion and Wardline both produce `finding` records with internal vocabulary. The wire shape that crosses into Filigree is the managed-clash form documented above. Locally each product's `Finding` struct has product-specific fields beyond the wire schema. |
| `run` / `run_id` | Clarion + Wardline | Each product has its own analyse/scan run lifecycle. The `run_id` field on a finding is namespaced by emitter (per `provenance.tool`); the strings are not assumed cross-product-meaningful. |

### Deferred clashes (tracked, not resolved)

| Term | Products | Status | Tracked by |
|---|---|---|---|
| L7 qualname format | Clarion ↔ Wardline | Clarion's L7 emits combined dotted `module.qualified_name`; Wardline's `FingerprintEntry` stores `(module, qualified_name)` as separate fields. No semantic clash today (Sprint 1 does not join across this boundary); becomes load-bearing at WP9 (Loom integrations). | [ADR-018](../clarion/adr/ADR-018-identity-reconciliation.md) amendment trigger; filigree issue `clarion-889200006a` (sprint:2 / wp:9). Trigger: WP9 attempts the first cross-product join. |

## Wardline-side terms (for cross-product reader benefit)

These terms are owned by Wardline. Listed here so a Clarion or Filigree reader does not assume Clarion-side semantics.

| Term | Wardline meaning |
|---|---|
| `Tier N` | Trust tier classification level applied to entities. Numeric. |
| `annotation_group` / `wardline_group` | Group of related Wardline annotations sharing a tier or policy band. Used as a `match_rules.type` value in Clarion guidance sheets. |
| `FingerprintEntry` | Wardline's storage object pairing `(module, qualified_name)`. See deferred clash above. |
| `governed default` | Wardline policy concept: a default value declared as policy-governed (rule IDs like `PY-WL-001-GOVERNED-DEFAULT`). |

## Shuttle (proposed)

Shuttle is not in flight. When Shuttle's design begins, the first design-review pass against this glossary should add Shuttle's authoritative terms and explicitly check `change`, `apply`, `commit`, `rollback`, `transaction` against the existing Loom vocabulary surface.

## History

- **2026-05-03** — Glossary created during the v0.1 skeleton audit (Sprint 2 kickoff). Seeded with the three managed ADR-mediated clashes, the three open clashes resolved by ADR-024, the no-clash informational entries, and the deferred ADR-018 amendment trigger.
