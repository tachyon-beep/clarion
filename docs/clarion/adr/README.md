## Backlog still tracked in the detailed design

The following decisions are still backlog items rather than authored ADR files. Their current summaries live in [../v0.1/detailed-design.md](../v0.1/detailed-design.md) §11 and [../v0.1/system-design.md](../v0.1/system-design.md) §12.

| ADR | Title | Current state |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-008 | Filigree file-registry displacement as breaking change | Superseded by ADR-014 |
| ADR-009 | Structured briefings vs free-form prose | Backlog |
| ADR-010 | MCP as first-class surface | Backlog |
| ADR-019 | SARIF property-bag preservation | Backlog |
| ADR-020 | Degraded-mode policy and explicit suite fallbacks | Backlog |

## Pre-implementation scope commitments

The priorities and scope implied by these ADRs are committed in [../v0.1/plans/v0.1-scope-commitments.md](../v0.1/plans/v0.1-scope-commitments.md). The ADR authoring sprint is staged against that memo.

## ADR acceptance criteria — Loom vocabulary discipline

ADRs introducing cross-product-visible field names must update [`docs/suite/glossary.md`](../../suite/glossary.md) before moving from Proposed to Accepted, with one of three explicit verdicts:

- **`no clash`** — the term is unique to this product, no sibling currently uses it
- **`managed clash`** — a sibling uses the same term; an explicit mapping table exists in the ADR (model: [ADR-017](./ADR-017-severity-and-dedup.md))
- **`renamed`** — the proposed term clashed with a sibling; this ADR renames the local term to avoid the clash

The verdict is part of acceptance evidence, not a courtesy. Three of v0.1's clashes (`severity`, `rule_id`, `finding` wire shape) shipped clean because they got managing ADRs at design time; three did not (`priority`, `critical`, `source`) and required retrofit via ADR-024. The rule converts the next clash from "discovered during implementation" to "blocked at design review." See `glossary.md` for federation-safety constraints — the glossary is a human-consulted design-review artifact, not infrastructure.
