# ADR-014: Filigree `registry_backend` Flag and Pluggable `RegistryProtocol`

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-04-18
**Deciders**: qacona@gmail.com
**Context**: Clarion v0.1 integration boundary with Filigree's file registry; joint deliverable (Clarion + Filigree, same author)

## Summary

Filigree gains a pluggable `RegistryProtocol` with two modes, selected via a `registry_backend` configuration flag: `local` (Filigree's current native registry — the default) and `clarion` (Filigree delegates file-identity operations to Clarion's HTTP read API). Clarion v0.1 ships expecting `registry_backend: clarion` and degrades to shadow-registry mode when the flag is absent. Because the same author maintains both products, Filigree's implementation lands alongside Clarion's v0.1 release rather than as a cross-team prerequisite.

## Context

Filigree today owns the file registry unconditionally. `file_records(id TEXT PRIMARY KEY)` is referenced by four NOT-NULL foreign keys (`scan_findings.file_id`, `file_associations.file_id`, `file_events.file_id`, `issues` via associations), and three code paths auto-create rows:

1. `POST /api/v1/scan-results` calls `_upsert_file_record` before inserting findings (`db_files.py:430-453`).
2. `create_observation(file_path=…)` calls `register_file` to bind the observation (`db_observations.py:135-147`).
3. `trigger_scan` / `trigger_scan_batch` call `tracker.register_file(...)` to populate `scan_runs.file_ids` (`mcp_tools/scanners.py:422, :586`).

Each auto-create path produces a Filigree-native `file_records.id` (UUID-derived: `f"{prefix}-f-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:10]}"`). Clarion's entity-identity scheme uses symbolic canonical names (ADR-003). The two schemes currently diverge: anything Clarion POSTs creates a shadow Filigree file row, and cross-tool "same file" queries have no answer.

Clarion v0.1 claims to own structural truth about the codebase (`loom.md` §2). That claim is inconsistent with Filigree silently minting file identities on every POST. A protocol boundary is needed.

`registry_backend` and `FILIGREE_FILE_REGISTRY_DISPLACED` do not exist in Filigree today — verified by `grep` across `/home/john/filigree` on 2026-04-17 (see `reviews/integration-recon.md` §2.1). Both are net-new additions.

## Decision

Filigree introduces a `RegistryProtocol` trait with two implementations.

**Mode `local` (default)**: Filigree's current behaviour. The three auto-create paths populate `file_records` using UUID-derived IDs. Filigree remains fully usable standalone — no Clarion dependency, no degradation.

**Mode `clarion`**: Filigree delegates `file_id` resolution to Clarion's HTTP read API. The three auto-create paths call `RegistryProtocol::resolve_file(path, language) -> file_id` which, under `clarion` mode, issues an HTTP GET to Clarion's read API. The returned `file_id` is Clarion's symbolic entity ID (`core:file:{hash}@{path}`). The `file_records` row is created in Filigree with that ID, preserving the existing foreign-key structure.

**Flag surfacing**: `registry_backend` appears in `GET /api/files/_schema.config_flags`. Clarion's capability probe reads it at every `clarion analyze` start. Present + value `clarion` → proceed with delegation. Absent or value `local` → Clarion enters shadow-registry mode and emits `CLA-INFRA-FILIGREE-SHADOW-REGISTRY` per batch.

**Error code**: `FILIGREE_FILE_REGISTRY_DISPLACED` is returned by Filigree to any caller that tries to directly mutate `file_records` (e.g., `register_file` MCP tool) while `registry_backend: clarion` is active. The write path is Clarion's; Filigree's direct file-registration MCP tool becomes a read-only query in `clarion` mode.

**Startup failure mode**: if Filigree starts with `registry_backend: clarion` but Clarion's read API is unreachable, Filigree refuses writes (returns `503 Service Unavailable` from the three auto-create paths) rather than silently degrading to `local`. An explicit `--allow-local-fallback` flag exists for single-operator recovery scenarios; the default is fail-closed.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Clarion-native registry without a flag — hard displacement

Filigree always delegates to Clarion. No `registry_backend` flag; no `local` mode.

**Pros**: single code path in Filigree; no dual-mode testing surface.

**Cons**: violates Loom federation (`loom.md` §4 composition law). Filigree becomes semantically dependent on Clarion running — "removing Clarion changes the meaning of Filigree's own data" (§5 failure test). `loom.md` §5's explicit Filigree example ("Filigree creates and closes tickets exactly the same way whether Clarion is installed or not") fails. Also makes Filigree's existing deployments (including `filigree` itself, which uses Filigree for its own issue tracking) require Clarion, which is absurd for a product that ships standalone today.

**Why rejected**: pairwise composability is a hard rule, not an aspiration.

### Alternative 2: Schema-level surgery — replace `file_records(id)` with a foreign key into Clarion

Eliminate `file_records` and reference Clarion's entity catalog directly via an external database handle or JSONB column.

**Pros**: single source of truth at the storage layer; no RPC round-trip on every operation.

**Cons**: fundamentally couples Filigree's database to Clarion's. Violates `loom.md` §6 ("A central store or database... No shared SQLite/Postgres sits under the suite"). Every Filigree operator would need a local Clarion database even in pure-Filigree deployments. Migration cost is high and irreversible.

**Why rejected**: the whole point of the Loom architecture is that each product owns its storage. Schema surgery is a stealth-monolith pattern.

### Alternative 3: Event-driven sync — Clarion pushes entity state to Filigree

Clarion maintains its catalog and publishes file-identity events to Filigree via a webhook or event bus. Filigree reconciles its `file_records` asynchronously.

**Pros**: keeps Filigree's storage independent; allows eventual consistency.

**Cons**: introduces an event-delivery mechanism that does not exist today. Filigree writes (from non-Clarion sources, e.g., manual scans, other Loom siblings) would have no immediate Clarion ID available and would need deferred reconciliation. Error-recovery semantics are complex (what if the event bus is down?). Also, Loom already prohibits shared infrastructure (`loom.md` §6) — an event bus qualifies.

**Why rejected**: too much mechanism for a problem that has a simpler synchronous answer.

### Alternative 4: Leave it as shadow-registry permanently — no displacement

Accept that Filigree mints its own file IDs forever; Clarion reconciles post-hoc via path + hash.

**Pros**: zero Filigree-side work; preserves total independence.

**Cons**: the "Clarion owns structural truth" claim in `loom.md` §2 becomes a lie — Filigree owns the authoritative file ID for everything it stores, and Clarion's catalog is the shadow. Cross-tool "same file" queries have no deterministic answer when file paths change. Issues referencing Filigree file IDs cannot round-trip to Clarion entity IDs without a fragile path-based join.

**Why rejected**: turns a v0.1 deferral into a permanent identity-model concession; the cost compounds across every future cross-tool query.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Preserves Filigree's standalone usability (`registry_backend: local` is the default).
- Makes "Clarion owns structural truth" honest: in `registry_backend: clarion` mode, Filigree's file IDs *are* Clarion's entity IDs, not a shadow mapping.
- Creates a clean contract surface for v0.2+ alternative registry backends (e.g., `registry_backend: git-objects`).
- `FILIGREE_FILE_REGISTRY_DISPLACED` surfaces the coupling explicitly; operators running `clarion` mode know why direct file-registration MCP calls fail.
- Capability probe (`GET /api/files/_schema.config_flags`) means Clarion discovers the mode at runtime rather than requiring synchronised deployment.

### Negative

- Two Filigree code paths per auto-create operation (local vs delegated). Testing surface doubles for file-registry operations.
- `registry_backend: clarion` mode introduces a synchronous RPC hop on every Filigree write that touches `file_records`. Latency impact: one local HTTP round-trip to Clarion (typically <5ms on loopback). Acceptable for developer-machine workloads; would need re-evaluation for high-throughput server deployments.
- Fail-closed startup (Filigree refuses writes if Clarion is unreachable under `clarion` mode) means operators must start Clarion before Filigree — or use the explicit `--allow-local-fallback` recovery flag.
- Shadow-registry mode (for operators who never want to run Clarion) remains available, but Clarion now has *two* v0.1 shapes it needs to test (`clarion` mode and shadow mode). ADR-020's degraded-mode policy covers the testing burden.

### Neutral

- Clarion's existing HTTP read API is the contract; no new endpoints are introduced for Filigree's consumption — `resolve_file(path, language)` is just a read through the existing file-entity query surface.
- The `FILIGREE_FILE_REGISTRY_DISPLACED` error code lives in Filigree's error-code registry alongside existing codes; it does not become a cross-product shared enum.

## Related Decisions

- [ADR-003](./ADR-003-entity-id-scheme.md) — symbolic entity IDs are what `clarion` mode uses as `file_records.id` values.
- [ADR-004](./ADR-004-finding-exchange-format.md) — findings intake uses the same `file_id` that `resolve_file` returns.
- ADR-008 (superseded) — earlier framing of this decision as a "feature flag"; the recon revealed it is an interface, not a flag.
- [ADR-016](./ADR-016-observation-transport.md) — the `create_observation(file_path=…)` auto-create path is one of the three delegated operations; under `registry_backend: clarion` mode the `file_id` resolution in that path uses this ADR's protocol regardless of whether ADR-016's transport is MCP-spawn (v0.1) or HTTP (v0.2).
- [ADR-017](./ADR-017-severity-and-dedup.md) — `mark_unseen=true` dedup relies on stable file IDs, which `clarion` mode provides and shadow mode does not.
- [ADR-018](./ADR-018-identity-reconciliation.md) — the qualname ↔ EntityId translation layer is adjacent; `clarion` mode's `file_id` resolution is one slice of the broader identity-reconciliation surface.
- [ADR-020](./ADR-020-degraded-mode-policy.md) (pending) — shadow-registry mode is one of the enumerated degraded modes.
- [ADR-022](./ADR-022-core-plugin-ontology.md) — file-kind entities are the narrowest ontology surface the plugin-vs-core boundary governs; ADR-022 states the `file` kind's core ownership as a first-class decision, and this ADR is the downstream consumer that depends on it.
