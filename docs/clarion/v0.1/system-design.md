# Clarion v0.1 — System Design

**Status**: Baselined for v0.1 implementation (post-ADR sprint 2026-04-18) — mid-level technical companion to requirements
**Baseline**: 2026-04-17 · **Last updated**: 2026-04-18
**Primary author**: qacona@gmail.com (with Claude)
**Companion documents**:
- [requirements.md](./requirements.md) — requirements (the *what*)
- [detailed-design.md](./detailed-design.md) — detailed design reference (implementation-level)
- [../../suite/loom.md](../../suite/loom.md) — Loom family doctrine (federation axiom, composition law, go/no-go test)

---

## Preamble

### What this document is

This is Clarion v0.1's **system design** at mid-level technical depth. It describes how Clarion realises the requirements: component topology, data structures at a conceptual level, key mechanisms, integration contracts, and architectural decisions. It stops before implementation detail — SQL schemas, Rust crate choices, exact rule-ID catalogues, full YAML config examples, and JSON-RPC wire specifics live in the detailed-design reference.

### How to read this

- Each section begins with an `Addresses:` header naming the requirements it satisfies. This is the unidirectional trace target for the requirements doc's `See:` lines.
- Diagrams use Mermaid (rendered natively on GitHub).
- Numbered sections follow the subsystem decomposition from the detailed-design, preserving navigation continuity across the three layers.
- ADRs are summarised in §12; authored ADR files live in [../adr/README.md](../adr/README.md). Unauthored backlog entries remain summarised here and in the detailed design.

### Layered docs

Requirements (what), system-design (how, mid-level), detailed-design (implementation). A reader asking "does Clarion resume after a crash?" looks in requirements. A reader asking "how does it resume?" looks here. A reader asking "what's the exact `busy_timeout` setting?" looks in the detailed-design.

### Loom framing

Clarion is one product in the Loom suite (see [../../suite/loom.md](../../suite/loom.md)). Every integration in this design satisfies the Loom federation axiom — Clarion is useful standalone, composes pairwise with each sibling, and is enrich-only with respect to sibling data. Sibling absence reduces Clarion's capability; it does not alter Clarion's semantics.

## 1. Context & Boundaries

**Addresses**: REQ-CATALOG-01, REQ-ARTEFACT-01, REQ-ARTEFACT-02, NFR-OPS-01, NFR-OPS-02, NFR-OPS-03, CON-LOOM-01, CON-LOCAL-01, NG-03.

### The Loom family and Clarion's place in it

Clarion is one of four products in the Loom suite, each authoritative for one bounded concern. The v0.1 suite is Clarion + Filigree + Wardline; Shuttle is proposed.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Loom["Loom suite (federation, not monolith)"]
        direction LR
        Clarion["<b>Clarion</b><br/>structural truth<br/>about the codebase"]

        Shuttle["<b>Shuttle</b> (proposed)<br/>transactional scoped<br/>change execution"]
    end

    Clarion -.->|"findings via<br/>POST /api/v1/scan-results"| Filigree

    Filigree -.->|"triage state<br/>(read-only)"| Clarion

    Shuttle -.->|"(v0.2+)<br/>change telemetry"| Filigree

    classDef proposed stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    class Shuttle proposed
```

Integration is narrow, additive, and point-to-point. No shared runtime, no shared store, no central orchestrator — integration is what the federation axiom ([../../suite/loom.md](../../suite/loom.md) §3-§6) permits and nothing more.

### Process topology

Clarion exposes three process types:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Install["clarion install (single binary)"]
        direction TB
        Analyze["clarion analyze<br/><i>one-shot batch</i>"]
        Serve["clarion serve<br/><i>long-running</i>"]
    end

    subgraph PluginSub["Language plugins (subprocess)"]
        direction TB
        PyPlugin["clarion-plugin-python<br/><i>LSP-style JSON-RPC</i>"]
    end

    Store[("`.clarion/clarion.db`<br/>SQLite WAL<br/><i>committed to git</i>")]

    Analyze -.->|"spawn per run"| PyPlugin
    Serve -.->|"spawn on demand<br/>for consult queries"| PyPlugin
    Analyze -->|"writer actor<br/>(sole writable connection)"| Store
    Serve -->|"writer actor + read pool"| Store
    Serve <-->|"stdio: MCP<br/>loopback: HTTP"| External["MCP clients<br/>HTTP consumers<br/>(Wardline in CI)"]
```

`clarion analyze` populates the store in a single batch. `clarion serve` hosts MCP over stdio (for consult-mode LLM agents) plus a read-only HTTP API over loopback (for sibling tools). Plugins are subprocesses spawned by either — they own the language-specific parsing and ontology.

### UX modes

| Mode | Surface | Purpose | v0.1 status |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCP-for-LLM | `clarion serve` over stdio | First-class product surface — consult-mode agents hold a cursor, navigate the graph, emit observations to Filigree | Primary |
| Catalog artefacts | `clarion analyze` writes `.clarion/catalog.json` + per-subsystem markdown | "I want to read the output" cases | Shipped |
| Semi-dynamic wiki | HTML served by `clarion serve` | Live finding list, in-browser guidance editing, consult entry points | v0.2 (deferred — NG-13) |

### Boundary contracts with the Loom siblings

Clarion's integration posture is **enrich-only**. Clarion works standalone (NFR-RELIABILITY-02's `--no-filigree` and `--no-wardline`); with siblings present, Clarion's briefings, guidance, and findings gain context. No sibling is required for Clarion's own data to be coherent.

- **Filigree** (enrich-only). Clarion emits findings and observations to Filigree; Clarion reads Filigree's triage state (`REQ-BRIEFING-05`) to enrich briefings. Filigree's absence degrades Clarion to local-only finding writes — semantics intact, convenience reduced.
- **Wardline** (enrich-only). Clarion ingests `wardline.yaml` + overlays + fingerprint + exceptions at analyse time; imports `wardline.core.registry.REGISTRY` at plugin startup. Wardline's absence degrades Clarion's annotations to "confidence_basis: clarion_augmentation" — Clarion still extracts what the code declares, it just doesn't cross-check against Wardline's canonical vocabulary.
- **Shuttle** (not yet). Scope explicitly disclaimed (NG-07). Clarion does not execute changes.

### What Clarion is NOT

Clarion is not a linter (NG-01, Wardline's territory), not a workflow tracker (NG-02, Filigree's territory), not an IDE (NG-03), not a grep-replacement (NG-04), not a dataflow/taint analyser (NG-05, Wardline's territory), not a hosted service (NG-06, `CON-LOCAL-01`), not a change executor (NG-07, Shuttle's territory).

## 2. Core / Plugin Architecture

**Addresses**: REQ-CATALOG-02, REQ-CATALOG-03, REQ-PLUGIN-01, REQ-PLUGIN-02, REQ-PLUGIN-03, REQ-PLUGIN-04, REQ-PLUGIN-05, REQ-PLUGIN-06, NFR-OPS-04, CON-WARDLINE-01.

### The responsibility split

The Rust core is language-*agnostic*, not language-*generic*. It has no fixed enum of entity kinds, no hardcoded concept of "function" or "class." Language plugins own the ontology — the set of kinds, edge kinds, tags, and rule IDs they emit — declared in a plugin manifest at startup. The core accepts anything the manifest permits.

This mirrors tree-sitter and LSP: adding a language (or a new semantic axis in an existing language) must not require upstream changes to the core.

| Owned by the core | Owned by the plugin |
|---|---|
| Storage (SQLite, writer-actor, schema, migrations) | Language parsing (AST / concrete syntax) |
| Analysis pipeline orchestration (phase order, checkpoint, resume) | Entity and edge extraction |
| Clustering (Leiden on imports + calls at module level) | Decorator / annotation detection |
| LLM provider abstraction + policy engine + prompt caching | Prompt template rendering (via `build_prompt` RPC) |
| MCP server + HTTP read API | Language-specific categorisation (entry points, HTTP routes, data models, test functions) |
| Finding emission to Filigree + compat probe | Language-specific rule emission (`CLA-PY-*`) |
| Guidance composition + fingerprinting | Identity reconciliation for sibling-tool qualnames |

### Plugin protocol

Plugins communicate with the core via **Content-Length-framed JSON-RPC 2.0** over stdio — the same framing LSP uses. Explicit framing is required because:

- JSON content may contain newlines (newline-delimited JSON is unsafe).
- Resumability after a plugin crash needs distinguishable message boundaries — a half-written `file_analyzed` message must be recoverable or discardable as a unit, not misinterpreted as part of the next message.
- Stdio streams don't have record boundaries natively; framing provides them.

Message framing:

```
Content-Length: <n>\r\n\r\n
<n bytes of JSON>
```

The core maintains one subprocess per plugin per process. Plugin supervision uses `tokio::process::Child` with explicit `wait()` to reap zombies; SIGPIPE is ignored so a dead plugin doesn't crash the core when the core writes to its stdin; a crash-loop circuit breaker disables a plugin after >3 crashes in 60 seconds (emits `CLA-INFRA-PLUGIN-DISABLED-CRASH-LOOP`).

### Plugin lifecycle

Plugins respond to two phases of lifecycle calls.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Core as Rust core
    participant Plugin as clarion-plugin-python

    Note over Core,Plugin: Startup
    Core->>Plugin: initialize { project_root, clarion_version }
    Plugin->>Core: { manifest: { kinds, edge_kinds, tags, capabilities,<br/>supported_rule_ids, prompt_templates } }

    Note over Core,Plugin: Batch phase — analyze
    Core->>Plugin: file_list(include, exclude)
    Plugin-->>Core: [files...]
    loop per file
        Core->>Plugin: analyze_file(path)
        Plugin-->>Core: stream of file_analyzed notifications:<br/>{ entity } | { edge } | { finding }
        Core->>Core: writer actor commits to store
    end

    Note over Core,Plugin: Consult phase — serve
    Core->>Plugin: build_prompt(entity_id, query_type, context, segments[])
    Plugin->>Core: { rendered: [seg1, seg2, seg3, seg4] }
    Core->>Core: invokes LLM with prompt-cache breakpoints
```

`analyze_file` uses streaming notifications (not request/response per entity) so the core can commit entities to the store as they arrive — backpressure via a bounded `tokio::sync::mpsc` (default 100 messages) prevents a runaway plugin from OOMing the core.

### Plugin manifest

Each plugin declares its ontology at startup. The manifest is the contract between core and plugin — the core refuses to run with a manifest missing required fields and refuses to accept entities / edges / findings whose `kind` isn't declared.

Key fields:
- `plugin_id` — the namespace for this plugin's emissions (e.g., `python`, `java`, `core`)
- `kinds` — every entity kind the plugin can emit (`function`, `class`, `protocol`, `global`, `module`, `package`, ...)
- `edge_kinds` — plugin-defined edge kinds (`imports`, `calls`, `inherits_from`, `decorated_by`, `uses_type`, `alias_of`, ...). Core reserves `contains`, `guides`, `emits_finding`, `in_subsystem`.
- `tags` — declared tag vocabulary (including Wardline annotation names for the Python plugin)
- `capabilities` — boolean flags per capability (`calls`, `imports`, `inherits_from`, ...) with `confidence_basis` per capability (`ast_match`, `name_match`, `clarion_augmentation`, ...)
- `supported_rule_ids` — rule IDs this plugin may emit, namespaced by prefix
- `prompt_templates` — list of named templates (`python:class:v1`, `python:module:v1`, ...) with per-segment slot specifications

### Plugin packaging

v0.1 plugins distribute via their language's own packaging (Python → PyPI). Installation via `pipx install clarion-plugin-python` into an isolated venv so plugin dependencies don't conflict with the analysed project's. A user-level `~/.config/clarion/plugins.toml` records the resolved executable path plus the Python version requirement. Plugin hash-pinning is deferred (NG-16).

### Python plugin specifics

The Python plugin is the v0.1 validating plugin and the reference implementation of the manifest contract.

**Parser dispatch**. Tree-sitter for structural extraction (entities, edges, direct imports, call-graph best-effort). LibCST for decorator argument extraction and fine-grained source-range recovery where tree-sitter is coarse. LibCST parse failures fall back to tree-sitter with a `CLA-PY-PARTIAL-PARSE` finding.

**Import resolution** (REQ-PLUGIN-05). Resolution uses an explicit policy:
- `sys.path` discovered via virtualenv introspection (`python -m site` against the supplied `python_executable` from `plugins.toml`) or, if none supplied, the ambient Python
- `src.` prefix stripped by default; configurable via `clarion.yaml:analysis.python.canonical_root`
- `__init__.py` re-exports produce `alias_of` edges; definition site wins for the canonical ID
- Unresolvable imports produce `python:unresolved:{module.path}` placeholder entities, reconciled when resolution later succeeds
- `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks are excluded from runtime-import edges (prevents spurious circular-import findings in typed codebases)

**Decorator detection** (REQ-PLUGIN-06). Direct-name match is insufficient — real Python code uses decorator factories (`@app.route("/health")`), stacked decorators (order matters), class decorators, and aliases (`validates = validates_shape`). Detection handles:
- Factory invocations: record the decorator name + call arguments as edge properties
- Stacked decorators: preserve order in a `decoration_order` edge property (matters for Wardline semantics)
- Aliases: follow name resolution; an alias to a Wardline-registered decorator counts as that decorator
- Legacy renames: consult Wardline's `LEGACY_DECORATOR_ALIASES` (from the directly-imported REGISTRY) to avoid double-counting old-name + new-name

**Serial-or-parallel posture**. v0.1 is serial within the plugin (one file at a time). Parallelism happens at the core level (multiple plugins, multiple LLM calls). Parallelism inside the plugin is deferred to v0.2.

### Observe-vs-enforce boundary (Principle 5)

The Python plugin detects *that* a Wardline annotation is present on a function (e.g., `@validates_shape`); Wardline's enforcer determines *whether* the function actually validates what it claims. Clarion tags the entity with `wardline.groups` / `wardline.annotations`; Wardline's findings (surfaced via Filigree) fill in the "does it actually comply?" answer.

This boundary is preserved by:
- Clarion importing Wardline's REGISTRY directly rather than redefining the decorator vocabulary (`CON-WARDLINE-01`)
- Clarion's plugin declaring Wardline decorator names in its manifest `tags`, but not re-implementing Wardline's rule logic
- `CLA-FACT-TIER-SUBSYSTEM-MIXING` (structural observation) being core-emitted (uses clustering) — Clarion is flagging that tiers disagree; Wardline would be the tool that decides *which* tier is correct

## 3. Data Model

### Property-graph generic model

Clarion's data model is a property graph with three record types: `Entity`, `Edge`, `Finding`. Plugin-defined strings in the `kind` field keep the core language-agnostic.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Entity ||--o{ Edge : "from / to"
    Entity ||--o{ Finding : "subject"
    Entity ||--o| Briefing : "contains (optional Summary)"
    Entity ||--o| WardlineMeta : "contains (optional)"

    Entity {
        EntityId id PK "plugin:kind:canonical_name"
        string plugin_id
        string kind "plugin-defined"
        string name
        string short_name
        EntityId parent_id FK

    }
    Edge {
        EdgeId id PK
        string kind "plugin-defined or core-reserved"
        EntityId from FK
        EntityId to FK
        map properties
        SourceRange source "optional"
    }
    Finding {
        FindingId id PK
        string rule_id "CLA-*, WL-*, COV-*, SEC-*"
        FindingKind kind "Defect/Fact/Classification/Metric/Suggestion"
        string severity "internal: INFO/WARN/ERROR/CRITICAL/NONE"
        float confidence "optional"
        EntityId entity_id FK
        string message
        list evidence
        string status "internal: open/ack/suppressed/promoted"
    }
    Briefing {
        string purpose
        Maturity maturity
        list risks
        list patterns
        list antipatterns
        KeyRelationships relationships
        KnowledgeBasis knowledge_basis
    }
```

### Entity

Every addressable thing in Clarion's catalog is an `Entity`: functions, classes, modules, packages, subsystems, guidance sheets, files. The kind is a plugin-defined string; the core does not enum it.

Key invariants:
- `id` is stable across file moves that don't change the canonical qualified name (REQ-CATALOG-06).
- `source` is `None` for non-source entities (guidance sheets, subsystems).
- `content_hash` (Blake3) is the cache-invalidation key for summaries.
- `first_seen_commit` / `last_seen_commit` record git provenance; dirty-tree runs record the underlying commit (REQ-CATALOG-07).

### Edge

Typed relationships between entities. Core reserves `contains`, `guides`, `emits_finding`, `in_subsystem`; all others are plugin-defined.

Edges are deduped by `(kind, from, to)` — the plugin's emitter may observe the same call twice for overloaded names; the store is idempotent.

### Finding

A structured claim-with-evidence — Principle 4. One record shape covers five kinds:

- **Defect** — a violation or bug; carries severity
- **Fact** — an observation of structure or behaviour (no severity — facts don't have severity, they have existence)
- **Classification** — "this entity is of type X" with confidence
- **Metric** — quantitative measurement
- **Suggestion** — non-enforced recommendation

Findings carry `supports` / `supported_by` chains for cross-tool reference: Clarion's `CLA-FACT-TIER-SUBSYSTEM-MIXING` may be `supported_by` a Wardline `WL-TIER-INCONSISTENT` finding on one of the members.

Status vocabulary is **Clarion-internal** (`open | acknowledged | suppressed | promoted_to_issue`); Filigree has its own vocabulary (`open | acknowledged | fixed | false_positive | unseen_in_latest`). The mapping is bidirectional (see §9).

### Entity Briefing

Structured, schema-validated summary (not prose) — REQ-BRIEFING-01. Fixed fields: `purpose`, `maturity`, `maturity_reasoning`, `risks`, `patterns`, `antipatterns`, `relationships`, `knowledge_basis`, `notes`.

`knowledge_basis` (REQ-BRIEFING-04) is computed at runtime from current guidance/finding state, not stored. A briefing gets `HumanVerified` if a matching guidance sheet was authored/reviewed in the last 90 days OR if the entity has a suppressed/acknowledged finding with a non-empty reason. Otherwise it's `StaticOnly`. `RuntimeInformed` is reserved for v0.2 (coverage ingest).

Detail levels: `short` (~60 tokens), `medium` (~300), `full` (~900), `exhaustive` (~1,800). These `~N` figures are typical token counts for well-formed entities. The hard ceilings (`≤100 / ≤400 / ≤1,500 / ≤3,600`, per REQ-BRIEFING-06) are what the renderer must enforce — exceeding them triggers truncation. The bounded-response contract is NFR-PERF-03.

### Guidance sheets

Guidance is an entity of `kind: guidance` with properties including `content` (markdown), `priority` (project | subsystem | package | module | class | function), `scope` (which query types this sheet applies to), `match_rules` (path / tag / kind / wardline_group / subsystem / entity), `expires`, `critical` (boolean — preserved across token-budget pressure), `source` (manual / wardline_derived / filigree_promotion).

Explicit entity targets get `guides` edges; pattern-based matches resolve at query time (§7 Composition).

### File entities

First-class entities (REQ-CATALOG-04). Properties include `size_bytes`, `line_count`, `mime_type`, and git metadata (`git_last_modified`, `git_last_modified_sha`, `git_churn_count`, `git_authors`). Code entities' `parent_id` chains resolve to a file entity, making the file-entity the unit of source-range anchoring.

### Subsystem entities

Core-emitted (§6 Phase 3). Properties include `cluster_algorithm` (`leiden`), `modularity_score`, `member_count`, `synthesised_at`. Member modules have `in_subsystem` edges.

### Wardline metadata

`WardlineMeta` hangs on entities that Wardline has declared. Includes `declared_tier` (one of `INTEGRAL | ASSURED | GUARDED | EXTERNAL_RAW`), `declared_groups` (1..17), `declared_boundary_contracts`, `annotation_hash` (from `wardline.fingerprint.json`), and `wardline_qualname` (the cross-tool identity handle for reconciliation).

### Identity reconciliation

Three independent identity schemes coexist across Clarion and Wardline:

| Scheme | Example | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Clarion `EntityId` | `python:class:auth.tokens::TokenManager` | Clarion |
| Wardline `qualname` | `TokenManager.verify` | Wardline's `FingerprintEntry` |
| Wardline exception-register `location` | `src/wardline/scanner/engine.py::ScanEngine._scan_file` | `wardline.exceptions.json` |

None are byte-equal for the same underlying symbol. Clarion maintains the translation layer — not a centralised identity service (that would violate the Loom federation axiom). Each reconciliation direction uses explicit mechanics:

- **Wardline fingerprint → Clarion**. For each `FingerprintEntry`, Clarion computes `(file_path, qualname) → EntityId` via Wardline's `module_file_map` (available at scan time from `ScanContext`). The reverse mapping is stored on the entity as `wardline_qualname`.
- **Wardline exception → Clarion**. The `location` string is parsed (`split("::", 1)` yields `{file_path, qualname}`); same mapping rule applies. Unresolvable entries emit `CLA-INFRA-WARDLINE-EXCEPTION-UNRESOLVED`.
- **SARIF → Clarion** (in the translator path). SARIF's `artifactLocation.uri` + `logicalLocations[].fullyQualifiedName` combine to produce an `EntityId`; unresolved results carry `metadata.clarion.unresolved: true`.

The `GET /api/v1/entities/resolve` endpoint (§9) exposes this translation layer as a public API so every sibling doesn't re-implement it. Wardline keeps its scheme; Clarion produces the join.

### SQLite with writer-actor concurrency

Clarion v0.1 uses SQLite in WAL mode as its sole persistence layer. The key decisions:

- **Single writer, multiple readers**: one writable connection lives in a dedicated tokio task (the *writer actor*); all mutations route through a bounded `mpsc::Sender<WriteOp>`.
- **Per-N-files transactions**: `clarion analyze` commits on a rolling boundary (default N=50, configurable). A long single transaction would pin the WAL and starve readers.
- **Read pool**: `deadpool-sqlite` with default 16 read-only connections for plugin processes, MCP handlers, HTTP endpoints, and the markdown renderer. WAL lets them read the committed snapshot without blocking writers.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Writers["Write-path sources"]
        direction TB
        Analyze["clarion analyze<br/>(entity/edge commits)"]

        direction TB
        Plugin["Plugin processes"]
        MCP["MCP tool handlers"]
        HTTPAPI["HTTP read API"]
        Renderer["Markdown renderer"]
    end

    DB[("clarion.db (WAL mode)<br/>journal_mode=WAL<br/>synchronous=NORMAL<br/>busy_timeout=5000ms")]

    Writers -->|"WriteOp"| Mpsc
    Mpsc --> SoleConn
    SoleConn -->|"commits<br/>(every N files)"| DB

    ReadPool["deadpool-sqlite<br/>read pool (default 16)"]
    DB -.->|"committed snapshots<br/>via WAL"| ReadPool
    Readers --> ReadPool

    CheckpointTask["Checkpoint task<br/>(truncate every 10 txns<br/>or on analyze completion)"]
    CheckpointTask -.-> DB
```

**Why not a single giant transaction**: Long transactions pin the WAL, prevent checkpoints from completing, and produce unbounded WAL growth. Per-batch transactions are the industry-standard posture for this workload.

**Writer-actor vs. shadow-DB**. The writer-actor model is the v0.1 default. A shadow-DB alternative (`clarion analyze --shadow-db` writes to `.clarion/clarion.db.new`, atomic-renames on completion) is available for users wanting zero-stale reads from a concurrent `clarion serve` during long analyze runs. See ADR-011.

### Crash safety

SQLite WAL + per-N-files transactions + explicit `PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL` give crash-safe semantics: a SIGKILL during analyze loses at most the last N-files batch. `clarion analyze --resume <run_id>` reads the run's checkpoint file (`runs/<run_id>/checkpoints.jsonl`) and continues from the last clean phase boundary.

### Git-friendly storage

`.clarion/clarion.db` is committable to git (NFR-OPS-03). SQLite files diff poorly — Clarion ships two features to handle this:

1. **Textual export**: `clarion db export --textual <out_dir>` produces deterministic JSON-lines dumps of entities, edges, guidance, findings. Sorted by id / (kind, from, to) so a one-entity change produces a one-line diff. Summary cache is excluded (rebuilds cheaply on next run).

2. **Merge helper**: `clarion db merge-helper <ours> <theirs> <base>` acts as a git merge driver, producing a deterministic merge: union of entities / edges / findings (last-writer-wins on `updated_at`), guidance conflicts surfaced with a `CONFLICT` marker per affected sheet, summary cache cleared. Registration via `.gitattributes` + `.git/config` (see detailed-design §4 for exact config).

### File layout

```
<project>/.clarion/
    clarion.db              # main store (plus WAL files beside it)

    clarion.log             # process log
    runs/<run_id>/          # per-run artefacts (config snapshot, log.jsonl, stats.json, partial.json)
    .gitignore              # default-excludes runs/*/log.jsonl

```

### Scale

For the elspeth target (~1,100 files, ~100-200k code entities, ~500k-1M edges, hundreds to low thousands of findings, ~200k summary cache rows): expected DB size 500MB-2GB (NFR-SCALE-02). Sub-millisecond read latencies for indexed lookups.

### What the store does NOT hold

- **Raw source code** — stored by reference; plugins read files on demand.
- **Compiled ASTs** — plugins regenerate per session; cheaper than keeping an opaque blob.
- **Raw LLM request/response bodies** — logged to `runs/<run_id>/log.jsonl` for audit (default git-excluded; NFR-SEC-05).
- **Filigree issue content** — Clarion stores association IDs; Filigree is authoritative for issue data.

## 5. Policy Engine

**Addresses**: REQ-CONFIG-01, REQ-CONFIG-02, REQ-CONFIG-03, REQ-CONFIG-04, REQ-CONFIG-05, REQ-BRIEFING-03, NFR-COST-01, NFR-COST-02, NFR-COST-03, CON-ANTHROPIC-01.

### Purpose

The policy engine decides, per unit of LLM work: whether to do it, which model, when (batch or on-demand), and how much it can cost. It reads `clarion.yaml` merged with user defaults and CLI flags, then dispatches work to the LLM orchestrator.

### Config hierarchy

```
~/.config/clarion/defaults.yaml          (user-level)
    └──┐
       ├─► merged → <project>/clarion.yaml
       │              └──┐
       │                 ├─► merged → CLI flags (highest precedence)
       │                 │              │
       │                 │              └─► effective config for this run
```

Three-tier merge order (user defaults → project → CLI) matches user expectations. Every `clarion analyze` run snapshots the effective config into `runs/<run_id>/config.yaml` for audit.

### Per-level policy

LLM work is scoped by *level* — function, class, global, module, subsystem, cross_cutting. Each level has `mode` (`batch | on_demand | off`), `model_tier` (`haiku | sonnet | opus`), and `summary_length` (`short | medium | full | exhaustive`). Overrides layer on top: `match: { path: "src/generated/**" }, levels: { all: { mode: off } }`.

### Profile presets

Named profiles compress the per-level configuration into one switch:

| Profile | Function | Class | Global | Module | Subsystem | Cost posture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `budget` | off | on_demand, haiku | filtered, haiku | batch, haiku | batch, sonnet | minimise |
| `default` | on_demand, haiku | batch, haiku | filtered, haiku | batch, sonnet | batch, opus | balanced |
| `deep` | batch, haiku | batch, sonnet | filtered, sonnet | batch, opus | batch, opus (exhaustive) | maximum depth |
| `custom` | user sets everything | | | | | — |

### Budget enforcement

Every `clarion analyze` does a **dry-run estimate first** (default `dry_run_first: true`) — counts entities per level, applies per-tier pricing, prints the estimate, confirms with the user. At run time, a budget watcher tracks running totals; `on_exceed: stop` halts dispatch and writes `runs/<run_id>/partial.json`; `on_exceed: warn` logs and continues.

Estimate accuracy: target ±50% (NFR-COST-03). The known error sources are subsystem synthesis cost (varies with cluster sizes) and prompt-cache hit rates (which depend on guidance composition). ±50% is tight enough to be useful, loose enough to be achievable without full per-call simulation.

### LLM provider abstraction

```
trait LlmProvider {
    async fn invoke(&self, req: LlmRequest) -> LlmResponse;
    fn estimate_cost(&self, req: &LlmRequest) -> CostEstimate;
    fn tier_to_model(&self, tier: &str) -> Option<ModelId>;
    fn caching_model(&self) -> CachingModel;
}
```

**Honest portability framing**: the trait anticipates multiple providers, but **v0.1's plugin-level prompt protocol assumes Anthropic prompt-caching semantics** (four `cache_control` breakpoints at specific segment boundaries). Adding a second provider that works with the same caching model: straightforward. Adding one that loses the four-segment structure: pay more per call. Adding one while preserving equivalent caching performance: structural refactor (v0.3+).

v0.1 ships `AnthropicProvider` only. `CON-ANTHROPIC-01` formalises this as a constraint, not an accident. The trait exists to keep testability high (`RecordingProvider` for replay) — not to promise cheap provider swaps.

### Prompt caching strategy

Anthropic prompt caching supports up to 4 cache-control breakpoints. Clarion exploits this layering:

| Segment | Content | Cache horizon |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | System prompt + project-level guidance | Global across the run |
| 2 | Subsystem-level or module-level guidance | Per-subsystem / per-module within the run |
| 3 | Per-entity guidance (tag, wardline-group, kind) | Within a tight batch |
| 4 | Specific entity content + immediate context | Not cached (varies per call) |

Plugins receive a `build_prompt` request with segment slots; templates render content into the specified ordered segments. For module synthesis on elspeth (~1,100 Sonnet calls), Segment 1 caches globally; for subsystem synthesis (~50 Opus calls), Segments 1+2 share across all calls — order-of-magnitude savings on expensive-tier token spend.

### Summary cache

Cache key: `(entity_id, content_hash, prompt_template_id, model_tier, guidance_fingerprint)`. Any change to any component → cache miss → fresh LLM call. Syntactic staleness is impossible.

**Semantic staleness** (three paths the cache key alone doesn't see):

1. **Graph-neighborhood drift**. Entity call-graph neighborhood shifts materially (hot-path transition) without its own text changing — its `risks` / `relationships` fields may be out of date. Mitigation: cache rows store `caller_count` / `fan_out`; entries whose neighborhood has shifted by >50% (`neighborhood_drift_threshold`, configurable) are flagged `stale_semantic: true`. Flagged rows are served with a header indicating staleness; next analyse refreshes them.

2. **Model-identity drift**. A tier name (`sonnet`) mapping to a new concrete model. The cache row already stores the concrete model; the tier resolver compares on write and treats a mismatch as a miss. No special handling needed.

3. **Guidance-worldview drift**. Guidance sheet's text is unchanged but underlying assumptions have gone stale. No automated signal; surfaced via staleness review (§7) and git-churn-based findings (`CLA-FACT-GUIDANCE-CHURN-STALE`).

**TTL backstop**. Cache rows older than `max_age_days` (default 180) are invalidated unconditionally on next query. Bounds silently-stale briefings.

**Churn-triggered eager invalidation**. When `CLA-FACT-GUIDANCE-CHURN-STALE` fires for a guidance sheet, cache rows whose `guidance_fingerprint` includes that sheet invalidate eagerly (not at TTL). Operators see stale-guidance findings *and* feel cost pressure to act.

### Observability

Per-run `stats.json` records total cost, per-level breakdown, per-model breakdown, cache hit rate, phase durations. Per-entity provenance in the `summary_cache` row records what was spent to produce each summary. `cost_report(since)` MCP tool returns structured cost data. Budget events emit `CLA-INFRA-BUDGET-WARNING` / `CLA-INFRA-BUDGET-EXCEEDED` findings.

## 6. Analysis Pipeline

**Addresses**: REQ-ANALYZE-01 through REQ-ANALYZE-07, REQ-FINDING-05, NFR-PERF-01, NFR-RELIABILITY-01, NFR-RELIABILITY-03.

### Phase flow

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Phase0["Phase 0 — Configure & dry-run<br/>(core, no LLM)<br/>Merge config; discover files;<br/>estimate cost; confirm budget"]
    Phase1["Phase 1 — Structural extraction<br/>(plugin, no LLM, streaming)<br/>Parse files, emit entities + edges + findings"]

    Phase5["Phase 5 — Module synthesis<br/>(LLM, sonnet tier, parallel)<br/>Module summaries from leaf summaries"]
    Phase6["Phase 6 — Subsystem synthesis<br/>(LLM, opus tier, parallel)<br/>Cluster synthesis, final boundaries,<br/>naming, descriptions"]
    Phase7["Phase 7 — Cross-cutting analyses<br/>(v0.1: core-only)<br/>Wardline ingest; structural findings;<br/>entity-set diff"]
    Phase8["Phase 8 — Emission<br/>(core, no LLM)<br/>Commit findings; render catalog JSON + markdown;<br/>write run stats; push to Filigree"]

    Phase0 --> Phase1 --> Phase15 --> Phase2 --> Phase3 --> Phase4 --> Phase5 --> Phase6 --> Phase7 --> Phase8

    Phase0 -.->|"checkpoint"| CheckPt0([checkpoint])
    Phase1 -.->|"checkpoint"| CheckPt1([checkpoint])
    Phase15 -.->|"checkpoint"| CheckPt15([checkpoint])
    Phase2 -.->|"checkpoint"| CheckPt2([checkpoint])
    Phase3 -.->|"checkpoint"| CheckPt3([checkpoint])
    Phase4 -.->|"checkpoint"| CheckPt4([checkpoint])
    Phase5 -.->|"checkpoint"| CheckPt5([checkpoint])
    Phase6 -.->|"checkpoint"| CheckPt6([checkpoint])
    Phase7 -.->|"checkpoint"| CheckPt7([checkpoint])
```

Each phase transition writes a checkpoint to `runs/<run_id>/checkpoints.jsonl`. `clarion analyze --resume <run_id>` reads the checkpoint file and resumes from the last clean phase boundary. Content-hash caching means resumed runs naturally skip unchanged-file work.

### Parallelism

- **Phase 1**: one plugin process, serial within the plugin for v0.1 (REQ-PLUGIN-04). The writer actor serialises commits but batches per-N-files.
- **Phases 1.5-3**: single-threaded core-only; cheap (seconds, not minutes).
- **Phases 4-6**: parallel LLM calls capped at `max_parallel_llm` per tier (default 8). Haiku can go wider, Opus stays lower to respect rate limits.
- **Phase 7**: Wardline ingest is file I/O (fast); structural-finding computation is graph traversal, parallelised over independent regions.

### Determinism

- All summarisation uses `temperature: 0`.
- Subsystem naming uses `temperature: 0.2` (natural name variation, human-reviewable).
- Leiden clustering uses a seeded RNG; seed recorded in run stats.
- Back-to-back runs against identical source + `RecordingProvider` produce byte-identical entity/edge/finding state.

### Failure & degradation

Every failure category emits a structured finding:

| Failure | Finding | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Plugin parse error on file | `CLA-PY-PARSE-ERROR` | skip file, continue |
| Plugin timeout (default 30s) | `CLA-PY-TIMEOUT` | skip file, continue |
| Plugin process crash | `CLA-INFRA-PLUGIN-CRASH` | core restarts plugin, resume at next file |
| LLM rate limit | (no finding; retry) | exponential backoff + jitter, up to `max_retries` |
| LLM non-transient error | `CLA-INFRA-LLM-ERROR` | skip entity, continue |
| Budget exceeded (`warn`) | `CLA-INFRA-BUDGET-WARNING` | log, continue |
| Budget exceeded (`stop`) | `CLA-INFRA-BUDGET-EXCEEDED` | halt dispatch, write partial manifest |
| Plugin crashes >10% of files | `CLA-INFRA-ANALYSIS-ABORTED` | abort, mark run failed |
| Plugin crashes >3 in 60s | `CLA-INFRA-PLUGIN-DISABLED-CRASH-LOOP` | circuit-breaker disables plugin for the run |

No silent fallbacks. Every failure has a finding. Aggregate failure counts appear in `runs/<run_id>/stats.json`.

### Entity-set diff (deletion detection)

At Phase 7, Clarion compares the current run's entity IDs against the prior run's (read from `runs/<prior_run>/stats.json`). For each entity present before and absent now:

- Emit `CLA-FACT-ENTITY-DELETED` against a synthetic deletion marker (`core:deleted:{former_entity_id}`).
- Surface the deletion via Filigree so issues carrying the orphan ID can be triaged.
- Guidance sheets with explicit-entity `match_rules` pointing at the deleted ID emit `CLA-FACT-GUIDANCE-ORPHAN`.
- Invalidate summary cache rows for the deleted entity.

Silent deletion is the no-go mode — before Rev 4, this path was silent. Two findings now guarantee the transition is visible (REQ-ANALYZE-04).

### Phase-7 structural findings

These combine signals Clarion uniquely holds — clusters from Phase 3, Wardline tier declarations, and prior-run state — into findings no sibling tool can compute alone:

- **`CLA-FACT-TIER-SUBSYSTEM-MIXING`** (WARN, heuristic). A subsystem has members declared across disagreeing Wardline tiers. Either a misclassification Wardline can't see or a latent tier boundary worth naming. Threshold: `min_outlier_count: 2` AND `min_outlier_fraction: 0.1` (configurable).
- **`CLA-FACT-SUBSYSTEM-TIER-UNANIMOUS`** (INFO, deterministic). Subsystem members share a uniform declared tier. Positive signal for tier-consistency reports.
- **`CLA-FACT-ENTITY-DELETED`** (INFO, deterministic). See above.

These belong in Phase 7 (not the plugin's Phase 1 emission) because they depend on clustering output and prior-run state — core-side concerns. Emitting them from the plugin would require the plugin to know about subsystems and prior runs (Principle 3 violation).

---

## 7. Guidance System

**Addresses**: REQ-GUIDANCE-01 through REQ-GUIDANCE-06, REQ-BRIEFING-05.

### Purpose

Institutional knowledge — what code means in context, known subtleties, reviewer priorities — attached to entities so every LLM query for that entity gets the same framing. The primary LLM-context-enrichment mechanism.

### Composition algorithm

Given `(entity_id, query_type, model_tier)`, Clarion composes the applicable guidance:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Start(["Query: entity_id,<br/>query_type, model_tier"])
    Resolve["1. Resolve entity context<br/>path, kind, tags,<br/>subsystem, ancestor chain,<br/>wardline groups"]
    Collect["2. Collect candidate sheets<br/>via unioned queries:<br/>explicit match / path / kind /<br/>tag / subsystem / wardline-group /<br/>ancestor / implicit global"]
    Filter["3. Filter<br/>drop sheets whose scope excludes<br/>this query_type; drop expired;<br/>deduplicate"]
    Sort["4. Sort by composition priority<br/>project → subsystem → package →<br/>module → class → function<br/>(ties broken by authored_at)"]
    Budget["5. Apply token budget<br/>greedy fill inner → outer;<br/>preserve critical:true;<br/>log dropped"]
    Render["6. Render into prompt segments<br/>per caching strategy (§5)"]
    Fingerprint["7. Compute guidance fingerprint<br/>blake3(sorted([(sheet.id,<br/>sheet.content_hash)]))"]
    Return(["Return: segments,<br/>sheets_used, sheets_dropped,<br/>fingerprint"])

    Start --> Resolve --> Collect --> Filter --> Sort --> Budget --> Render --> Fingerprint --> Return
```

### Authoring workflows

| Surface | Workflow |
|---|---|
| CLI | `clarion guidance create --match path=src/auth/** --priority subsystem` |
| CLI | `clarion guidance edit <id>` / `show` / `delete` |
| CLI | `clarion guidance list [--for-entity <id>]` / `--stale` / `--expired` |
| MCP | `propose_guidance(entity_id, content, match_rules)` — produces a Filigree **observation**, not a sheet |
| CLI | `clarion guidance promote <filigree_obs_id>` — promotes observation to sheet |
| Wardline | Automatic on every `clarion analyze` with `wardline.yaml` present |
| Export / import | `clarion guidance export --to <dir>` / `clarion guidance import <dir>` |

The `propose_guidance` → observation → explicit promote flow is the v0.1 defence against guidance-poisoning via adversarial LLM output (`NFR-SEC-02`). A single compromised LLM call cannot poison every future prompt because promotion requires operator action.

### Wardline-derived guidance

On every `clarion analyze` run with `wardline.yaml` present:

- **Per declared tier assignment** → module-priority sheet: "This module contains declared Tier-N entities (list). Summaries should reflect Tier-N posture."
- **Per boundary contract** → subsystem-priority sheet: "Data crossing boundary `<contract>` carries Tier N; downstream users must not …"
- **Per annotation group in use** → project-priority sheet referencing wardline's §7 paragraph for that group.

All auto-generated sheets tagged `source: wardline_derived`, `critical: true`. Regenerated every analyse; user-edited overrides preserved by ID and marked `source: wardline_derived_overridden`.

Drift between `wardline.yaml` and derived guidance (Wardline runs at commit cadence; Clarion at batch cadence) surfaces as `CLA-FACT-GUIDANCE-STALE` finding.

### Staleness signals tied to code churn

Guidance is an accumulating stock with no intrinsic quality signal — especially `critical: true` sheets (last dropped from token budget pressure) can stay in use long after their assumptions drift.

On every analyze, for each guidance sheet:

- Compute aggregate `git_churn_count` delta over matched entities since `authored_at` or `reviewed_at`.
- Threshold exceeded (default 50 commits; 20 for `critical: true` sheets) → emit `CLA-FACT-GUIDANCE-CHURN-STALE` with `confidence: 0.7, confidence_basis: heuristic`.
- Asymmetric threshold is deliberate: critical sheets shape LLM output most, so their staleness matters most.

Auto-expiry is NOT the design — the stale signal pushes operators toward review; the decision stays with humans.

### Triage-state feedback into briefings

Filigree's finding-lifecycle state (suppressed, acknowledged) is institutional knowledge in the same shape as guidance. When rendering a briefing for an entity, Clarion queries Filigree for findings matching the entity:

- If the briefing's `notes` field is empty and there are ≤3 suppressed/acknowledged findings with reasons → render inline as `"Operator-acknowledged: <rule_id> — <suppression_reason> (Filigree finding <finding_id>)"` per line.
- If >3 or notes is already populated → synthesise one `RiskItem` with `tag: "operator-acknowledged"`, `severity: INFO`, `description: "N findings on this entity have been triaged by operators — see Filigree for suppression reasons."`

The guidance fingerprint (§5 Caching) incorporates the set of acknowledged finding IDs so cache invalidates when triage state changes.

This is a rendering change on an existing data path (the consult tool already fetches findings for entity pages). No new storage, no new sync mechanism. Read-only from Clarion's side.

### Lifecycle

- **Expiry**: expired sheets excluded from composition but kept in store (`clarion guidance list --expired`); `CLA-FACT-GUIDANCE-EXPIRED` per run.
- **Review cadence**: optional `reviewed_at`; `clarion guidance list --stale` for sheets not touched in N days.
- **Change tracking**: edit → new `content_hash` + updated `updated_at` → dependent summary cache entries invalidate at next query.
- **Conflict**: sheets are additive; inner sheets override outer by priority ordering; all sheets presented to the LLM in priority order with level labels so intended overrides are visible.

---

## 8. MCP Consult Surface

**Addresses**: REQ-MCP-01 through REQ-MCP-06, NFR-PERF-02, NFR-PERF-03.

### Cursor-based session model

Every MCP session has server-held state:
- `cursor` — the current `EntityId` (the "here I am" position)
- `breadcrumbs` — navigation history
- `scope_lens` — filter for neighbour queries (`Structural | Taint | Subsystem | Wardline`)
- `session_cost` — per-session LLM spend accumulator
- `proposed_guidance`, `emitted_observations` — tracking for writes

Navigation tools update the cursor; inspection tools default to the cursor. An agent says `goto(id)` once, then `summary()`, `neighbors()`, `callers()` all operate on that entity — no re-passing the ID. This mirrors the way human operators actually consult a catalog ("look at this, then show me callers, then zoom out to the module").

### Scope lens

The scope lens shapes neighbour queries without changing their signatures:

- **Structural** (default) — callers, callees, contains, contained_in. What the graph says.
- **Taint** (v0.2) — follow Wardline tier-flow paths. Reserved for v0.2 when Wardline dataflow findings are integrated.
- **Subsystem** — stay within the current entity's subsystem. Useful for "what's in this subsystem?" questions.
- **Wardline** — follow declared boundary-contract chains. "Where does data flow in/out of this boundary?"

### Tool catalogue by category

**Navigation**: `goto(id)`, `goto_path(path, line?)`, `back()`, `zoom_out()`, `zoom_in(child_id)`, `breadcrumbs()`

**Inspection**: `summary(id?, detail?)`, `source(id?, range?)`, `metadata(id?)`, `guidance_for(id?)`, `findings_for(id?, filter?)`, `wardline_for(id?)`

**Neighbours**: `neighbors(id?, edge_kind?, direction?)`, `callers(id?)`, `callees(id?)`, `children(id?, kind_filter?)`, `imports_from(id?)`, `imported_by(id?)`, `in_subsystem(id?)`, `subsystem_members(id?)`

**Search**: `search_structural(query)`, `search_semantic(query, limit?)`, `find_by_tag(tag, scope?)`, `find_by_wardline(tier?, group?)`, `find_by_kind(kind, scope?)`

**Findings & observability**: `list_findings(filter)`, `emit_observation(id, text)`, `promote_observation(obs_id, issue_template?)`, `cost_report(since?)`

**Guidance**: `show_guidance(id?)`, `list_guidance(filter?)`, `propose_guidance(id, content, rules?)`, `promote_guidance(obs_id)`

**Scope / session**: `set_scope_lens(lens)`, `session_info()`

### Exploration-elimination shortcuts (Principle 2)

Every common explore-agent question is a pre-computed shortcut:

`find_entry_points(scope?)`, `find_http_routes(scope?)`, `find_cli_commands(scope?)`, `find_data_models(scope?)`, `find_config_loaders(scope?)`, `find_tests(scope?)`, `find_fixtures(scope?)`, `find_deprecations(scope?)`, `find_todos(scope?)`, `find_dead_code(scope?)`, `find_circular_imports(scope?)`, `find_coupling_hotspots(scope?)`, `recently_changed(since?, scope?)`, `high_churn(limit?, scope?)`, `what_tests_this(id)`

All `scope?` parameters accept either an `EntityId` (confine results to descendants of that entity, typically a subsystem or package) or a path glob (`"src/auth/**"`). Omitted → whole project.

### Response shape

Every tool returns a common envelope:

```json
{
  "result": { /* tool-specific data */ },
  "cursor": "<updated cursor EntityId if navigation>",
  "briefing": {
    "purpose": "...",
    "maturity": "stable",
    "risks": [...],
    "patterns": [...],
    "antipatterns": [...],
    "relationships": {...}
  }
}
```

`briefing` is structured (not prose) using the `EntityBriefing` schema. At `short` detail it's ~60 tokens; at `medium`, ~300 tokens. LLMs consume it as data, not narrative.

### Token budgeting per response

Budget targets per tool:

| Tool | Budget |
|---|---|
| `summary(short)` | ≤100 tokens |
| `summary(medium)` | ≤400 |
| `summary(full)` | ≤1,500 |
| `neighbors` / `callers` / `callees` / `children` | ≤20 results × ≤50 tokens each |
| `source` | paginated if >2,000 tokens |
| `search_*` | ≤10 results |

Configurable per-session via `set_budget(tool, max_tokens)`. Unbounded responses re-introduce the context-pollution problem Clarion exists to solve (Principle 2).

### Consent gates

Write-effect tools (`emit_observation`, `promote_observation`, `propose_guidance`, `promote_guidance`) return a draft for human confirmation by default. Headless agent-walk mode enables direct writes via client-declared `capabilities: { auto_emit: true }` on initialize.

### Session lifetime

- Created on MCP `initialize` (≤100ms, NFR-PERF-02).
- Default idle timeout: 1 hour.
- State persisted to `.clarion/sessions/<id>.json` for reconnection.
- Admin surface: `clarion sessions list` / `clarion sessions close <id>`.

## 9. Integrations

**Addresses**: REQ-FINDING-03, REQ-FINDING-04, REQ-FINDING-05, REQ-FINDING-06, REQ-HTTP-01, REQ-HTTP-02, REQ-HTTP-03, REQ-HTTP-04, REQ-INTEG-FILIGREE-01 through -05, REQ-INTEG-WARDLINE-01 through -06, CON-FILIGREE-01, CON-FILIGREE-02, CON-WARDLINE-01.

### Filigree

**Posture**: Clarion owns file registry and code entities; Filigree owns workflow, issues, observations, findings lifecycle. Integration is via Filigree's native `POST /api/v1/scan-results` intake plus (when supported) a pluggable `RegistryProtocol` where Filigree consults Clarion for file resolution.

#### Wire format

Clarion POSTs to `POST /api/v1/scan-results`:

```json
{
  "scan_source": "clarion",
  "scan_run_id": "run-2026-04-17-153002",
  "mark_unseen": true,
  "create_observations": false,
  "complete_scan_run": true,
  "findings": [
    {
      "path": "src/auth/tokens.py",
      "rule_id": "CLA-PY-STRUCTURE-001",
      "message": "Circular import detected between auth.tokens and auth.sessions",
      "severity": "medium",
      "line_start": 12,
      "line_end": 12,
      "suggestion": "Move the shared type to a third module",
      "metadata": {
        "kind": "defect",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "confidence_basis": "ast_match",
        "clarion": {
          "entity_id": "python:class:auth.tokens::TokenManager",
          "related_entities": ["python:class:auth.sessions::SessionStore"],
          "internal_severity": "WARN",
          "internal_status": "open"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Key contract properties:

- **Extension slot is `metadata`**, not `properties`. Top-level keys outside the enumerated set are silently dropped by Filigree. Clarion's richer fields nest under `metadata.clarion.*`.
- **Line fields are `line_start` + `line_end`** (not a single `line`).
- **Severity is lowercase `{critical, high, medium, low, info}`** on the wire. Unknown values coerce to `info` and surface in `response.warnings[]` — Clarion inspects `warnings[]` on every POST (REQ-INTEG-FILIGREE-01).
- **`scan_run_id` lifecycle**: Clarion creates the run at Phase 0 via `create_scan_run` MCP tool; intermediate posts use `complete_scan_run=false`; final post uses `complete_scan_run=true`. Resume (`--resume`) reuses the same `run_id` and posts with `mark_unseen=false`.

#### Severity mapping

| Clarion internal | Filigree wire | Reverse (read-back) |
|---|---|---|
| `CRITICAL` | `critical` | `CRITICAL` |
| `ERROR` | `high` | `ERROR` |
| `WARN` | `medium` | `WARN` |
| `INFO` | `info` | `INFO` |
| `NONE` (facts) | `info` (with `metadata.clarion.kind = "fact"`) | `NONE` |

Clarion's internal value is preserved in `metadata.clarion.internal_severity` for lossless round-trip. Read-back consults that field first; falls back to `severity` only if absent (e.g., for findings from Wardline that don't set Clarion-specific metadata).

#### Dedup policy

Filigree dedups by `(file_id, scan_source, rule_id, coalesce(line_start, -1))`. Entities moving within a file produce two findings — v0.1 workaround is `mark_unseen=true` (old-position findings transition to `unseen_in_latest` on next run). `clarion analyze --prune-unseen` removes stale `unseen_in_latest` findings older than 30 days (configurable).

Server-side per-entity dedup (a Filigree feature that supersedes this workaround) is deferred (NG-21).

#### Registry-backend consumption

When Filigree ships `registry_backend: clarion`, Clarion serves as Filigree's file registry: Filigree's three auto-create paths (scan-results ingest, observation creation with `file_path`, `trigger_scan`) route through `RegistryProtocol` to Clarion's HTTP read API for `file_id` resolution.

Absent the flag, Clarion operates in **shadow-registry mode**: findings POSTed normally, Filigree auto-creates `file_records` under its native rules, `CLA-INFRA-FILIGREE-SHADOW-REGISTRY` appears in the compat report. Clarion's "owns the file registry" claim downgrades to "owns the entity catalog; Filigree shadows the file mapping" — functional, but the identity story is looser.

See §11 and `CON-FILIGREE-02`.

#### Observation transport

Observations created from `clarion analyze` (auto-generated on Wardline-derived guidance events, etc.) and from `clarion serve` MCP `emit_observation` tool go to Filigree.

- **v0.1 path** (ADR-016): Clarion spawns `filigree mcp` as a subprocess and uses Filigree's existing MCP `create_observation` tool over stdio. One subprocess per `clarion analyze` invocation; one long-lived subprocess for `clarion serve`. Observation HTTP endpoint deferred to v0.2 per Q1 scope commitment.
- **v0.2 retirement**: Filigree adds `POST /api/v1/observations` with a schema parallel to the MCP tool. Clarion's capability probe detects presence via `HEAD /api/v1/observations`; emit path switches to HTTP and the subprocess-spawn path retires.

#### Schema compatibility

CI runs a schema-pin test against a tagged Filigree release's `GET /api/files/_schema` output. Pins `valid_severities`, `valid_finding_statuses`, `valid_association_types`, and sort-field lists. Mismatch fails CI (NFR-COMPAT-01).

`scan_source` is free-form server-side (Filigree's `_schema` doesn't enumerate it). Suite-wide reserved values: `clarion`, `wardline`, `cov`, `sec`.

#### `metadata` nesting convention

Clarion → `metadata.clarion.*`. Wardline SARIF-translated findings → `metadata.wardline_properties.*`. A future tool (e.g., `cov`) would nest under `metadata.cov.*`. Published in Filigree docs to prevent collisions (v0.1 prerequisite, see §11 "Prerequisites named here").

### Wardline

**Posture**: Wardline runs at commit cadence. The long-term vision is Wardline pulling current state from Clarion; the v0.1 reality is narrower because Wardline has no HTTP client yet. Clarion ingests Wardline state from files on disk in v0.1.

#### State-file ingest

| File | v0.1 ingest | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `wardline.yaml` + overlays | YES | Tier declarations, boundary contracts, group assignments → entity `WardlineMeta` + auto-derived guidance |
| `wardline.fingerprint.json` | YES | Per-function annotation hash + qualname → `WardlineMeta.annotation_hash`, `wardline_qualname` |
| `wardline.exceptions.json` | YES | Active exceptions → entities tagged `wardline.excepted` |
| `wardline.sarif.baseline.json` | YES (read-only) | Source for SARIF→Filigree translator |
| Other Wardline state files (compliance, conformance, perimeter, retrospective) | NO (v0.2) | Not yet relevant to Clarion's catalog shape |

#### Direct REGISTRY import

Clarion's Python plugin imports `wardline.core.registry.REGISTRY` at startup (requires the `wardline` package installed in the plugin's pipx venv). `REGISTRY_VERSION` is pinned at Clarion release time. Skew behaviour (REQ-INTEG-WARDLINE-01 + NFR-COMPAT-02):

- Exact match → proceed normally.
- Additive-newer (same major, same or higher minor) → proceed with warning; decorators in the installed REGISTRY not in Clarion's pin detected with `confidence_basis: "clarion_augmentation"`.
- Major-bump or older → fall back to hardcoded registry mirror (`wardline_registry_v<pin>.py`); emit `CLA-INFRA-WARDLINE-REGISTRY-MIRRORED`; findings carry `confidence_basis: "mirror_only"`.

The YAML/JSON descriptor export of REGISTRY (enabling non-Python plugins) is a Wardline v0.2 prerequisite (see §11 "Prerequisites named here", NG-25).

#### SARIF → Filigree translator

`clarion sarif import <sarif_file> [--scan-source <name>]`. A general-purpose feature, not a Wardline-specific bridge — Semgrep, CodeQL, Trivy, and every future SARIF emitter land through the same translator.

Translator behaviour:

- SARIF `result.locations[].physicalLocation` → Filigree `path` + `line_start` + `line_end`
- SARIF `result.level` (`error / warning / note`) → Filigree severity (`high / medium / info`)
- SARIF `result.properties` → `metadata.<driver>_properties.*` (literal pass-through). Wardline's 44 `wardline.*` extension keys land under `metadata.wardline_properties.*`.
- `--scan-source` tags the emission (defaults to the SARIF driver name, lowercased).

#### Wardline-sourced flow evolution

- **v0.1**: Wardline emits SARIF to disk; `clarion sarif import wardline.sarif.baseline.json --scan-source wardline` posts to Filigree. Translator owned Clarion-side.
- **v0.2+** (NG-20 / ADR-015): Wardline gains a native `POST /api/v1/scan-results` emitter. What moves is *who owns the Wardline-specific mapping* — not whether SARIF translation exists. The translator stays (other SARIF sources remain).

### HTTP Read API

`clarion serve` hosts a read-only HTTP API on `127.0.0.1` (configurable bind).

#### Endpoints

```
GET  /api/v1/entities?file=<path>&kind=<kind>&tag=<tag>
GET  /api/v1/entities/{id}
GET  /api/v1/entities/{id}/neighbors?edge=<kind>&direction=<dir>
GET  /api/v1/entities/{id}/summary?detail=<level>
GET  /api/v1/entities/{id}/guidance
GET  /api/v1/entities/{id}/findings
GET  /api/v1/entities/resolve?scheme=<scheme>&value=<value>[&file=<path>]
GET  /api/v1/findings?tool=<tool>&rule=<rule>&kind=<kind>&status=<status>
GET  /api/v1/wardline/declared?scope=<entity_id|path>
GET  /api/v1/state
GET  /api/v1/health
GET  /api/v1/metrics     # Prometheus-compatible
```

#### Entity resolve oracle

`GET /api/v1/entities/resolve?scheme=<scheme>&value=<value>` — the identity-translation layer exposed as a public API. Schemes accepted in v0.1: `wardline_qualname`, `wardline_exception_location`, `file_path`, `sarif_logical_location`. Response includes `resolution_confidence` (`exact | heuristic | none`) and alternative candidates for non-exact matches.

Why this exists: every sibling tool consuming Clarion should ask in *their* native identity scheme, not embed Clarion's ID format. The alternative is every sibling re-implementing Clarion's ID generation, which couples them all to Clarion's ID scheme changes. `resolve` lets them stay decoupled (enrichment, not load-bearing).

404 behaviour: returns 200 with `resolution_confidence: "none"` and empty `entity_id` — distinguishes "Clarion doesn't know this" from "Clarion is down."

#### Authentication — UDS default, token fallback (ADR-012)

Loopback is not a security boundary on modern dev hosts (shared containers, devcontainers, and other local processes all sit on 127.0.0.1). v0.1 defaults to Unix domain socket authentication so that filesystem permissions are the boundary, not network topology.

**Default — UDS** (`serve.auth: uds`):
- Binds `<project_root>/.clarion/socket` with mode 0600, owner = current UID.
- HTTP/1.1 over UDS; no Bearer header required.
- Only the owning UID can connect; shared-Docker / multi-user-host scenarios closed structurally.
- No TCP bind at all — DNS-rebinding attack surface (T-05) is inapplicable.

**Fallback — TCP + Bearer token** (`serve.auth: token`):
- Auto-default on Windows (UDS support patchy until 10 1803+); explicit opt-in elsewhere for cross-UID-namespace access, SSH port-forwarding, or containerised clients.
- `clarion serve` auto-mints `.clarion/auth.token` on first run (mode 0600, `clrn_<43 chars>` format).
- OS keychain promotion via `clarion serve auth promote-to-keychain`.
- Rotation via `clarion serve auth rotate` with 24-hour grace window.
- Scoping: v0.1 has one project-wide read token; per-endpoint scoping is v0.2.

**Explicit-none** (`serve.auth: none` or `--i-accept-no-auth`):
- Allowed but loud: emits `CLA-INFRA-HTTP-AUTH-DISABLED` (severity ERROR) per serve startup; persistent warning banner in logs. For air-gapped CI with external ingress control or operators with strong local reasons.

**CI integration**: `clarion check-auth --from wardline` returns exit 0 if the serve endpoint is reachable and authenticated under whichever mode is active. Wardline in CI picks up the token via `CLARION_TOKEN` env (preferred) or `.clarion/auth.token` bind-mount when in token mode.

TLS is out of scope for v0.1. Operators wanting network exposure terminate TLS at a reverse proxy.

#### ETag-style caching

Every response carries `X-Clarion-State: <hash>`. Clients can supply `If-None-Match: <hash>` for cheap revalidation; unchanged → 304.

Wardline in CI polls at commit cadence — ETag revalidation reduces load on Clarion and bandwidth for the consumer. State hash is per-run (not per-entity) for v0.1 simplicity.

## 10. Security

**Addresses**: NFR-SEC-01 through NFR-SEC-05, REQ-CONFIG-05.

Security is a first-class concern in v0.1 because Clarion sends source code to a third-party LLM provider, persists LLM-derived content in a git-committed store, and exposes an HTTP API that Wardline consumes cross-process. The threats are concrete and the defences belong in v0.1, not later.

### Threat model (v0.1 scope)

| Threat | Severity | Surface | v0.1 defence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Secret exfiltration to LLM provider | Critical | `.env`, test fixtures, committed API keys → entities → Anthropic API | Pre-ingest secret scanner; findings block LLM dispatch |
| Prompt injection via source | Critical | Adversarial docstrings / comments → briefing field values → future-prompt poisoning via cache | Schema validation + untrusted-content delimiters + `knowledge_basis: static_only` |
| Guidance poisoning via LLM-proposed sheets | High | `propose_guidance` MCP tool promotes attacker text into prompts | Manual promotion gate — proposals create observations, not sheets |
| HTTP API reachable by other local processes | High | `clarion serve` on shared dev host / container | UDS default (mode 0600, UID-scoped); TCP+token fallback on Windows / cross-UID namespaces. See ADR-012. |
| DB tampering via committed `.clarion/clarion.db` | Medium | Bad actor edits DB, commits, poisons teammate briefings | Content-hash cross-check on load (v0.2); `clarion db verify` CLI |
| LLM audit-log leakage via git | Medium | `runs/<run_id>/log.jsonl` contains request/response bodies | Default-excluded from git |
| Personal API key charged when committing team DB | Medium (operator) | Developer commits DB generated with personal key | Operator guidance; `--audit-key` hint |
| Plugin subprocess compromise | Medium | Malicious third-party plugin reads source or exhausts host resources | Hybrid authority per ADR-021: path jail, Content-Length ceiling, entity-count cap, per-plugin `prlimit` RSS. Full syscall sandbox + plugin hash-pinning deferred to v0.2 (NG-16) |

### Pre-ingest redaction

Before any file content reaches the LLM (Phases 4, 5, 6), Clarion runs a pre-ingest secret scanner on the file buffer:

- **Tool**: bundled `detect-secrets` (or equivalent Rust-native scanner). Bundled binary — does not depend on the analysed project having `detect-secrets` installed.
- **Scope**: every file in `analysis.include` is scanned; exclusion globs apply *after* scanning (excluded files never reach the LLM regardless).
- **Policy on finding**:
  - Unredacted secret → `CLA-SEC-SECRET-DETECTED` (severity: ERROR) + **block LLM dispatch for that file**. Entities in the file still land in the store with summaries marked `briefing_blocked: secret_present`.
  - False-positive whitelist: `.clarion/secrets-baseline.yaml` (same format as `detect-secrets`' baseline; committable and reviewable).
  - Override: `clarion analyze --allow-unredacted-secrets` requires explicit confirmation prompt and records the override in `stats.json`.
- **Coverage**: high-entropy strings, common API key patterns (AWS, GitHub, Anthropic, Stripe, etc.), RSA private key headers, JWT-looking tokens.

This is a defensive measure, not a vulnerability scanner. False negatives exist; operators should not commit secrets and rely on Clarion to catch them.

### Prompt-injection containment

Source files contain docstrings, comments, and string literals that may be adversarial — either from third-party packages with hostile maintainers or from unreviewed PRs in open-source repos.

Layered defences:

1. **Segment-boundary discipline**. Prompt-caching (§5) places system prompt + project-level guidance in Segment 1 (stable, trusted) and untrusted entity content in Segment 4 (varies per call, untrusted). Plugin templates render file content inside explicit `<file_content trusted="false">...</file_content>` delimiters; templates are reviewed as part of plugin release.

2. **Structured-output schema validation**. Every briefing round-trips through the `EntityBriefing` JSON schema. An injected "output plain text instead" instruction fails validation; after one failed retry the run emits `CLA-INFRA-BRIEFING-INVALID` and skips the entity.

3. **Controlled-vocabulary enforcement**. `patterns` and `antipatterns` fields are constrained to the core + plugin vocabulary. Novel tags are logged as `CLA-FACT-VOCABULARY-CANDIDATE` for human review; they don't promote into future prompts silently.

4. **`knowledge_basis` propagation**. Briefings derived from LLM output (no human review) carry `knowledge_basis: static_only`. Agents consuming Clarion briefings should treat `static_only` claims as hypotheses, not assertions.

5. **Guidance promotion gate**. `propose_guidance(entity_id, content, rules?)` creates a **Filigree observation**, not a sheet. Promotion to a sheet requires explicit `clarion guidance promote <obs_id>` CLI action. A single adversarial LLM call cannot poison every future prompt.

6. **Prompt-cache poisoning countermeasures**. Summary-cache hits are keyed on `guidance_fingerprint`; a newly-promoted guidance sheet changes the fingerprint and forces re-summarisation. A compromised briefing never re-enters the cache without the prompt that produced it re-running.

### Defences NOT in v0.1 (named, not silent)

- **Full syscall sandbox** (seccomp/landlock). v0.1 enforces path jail, Content-Length ceiling, per-run entity-count cap, and per-plugin RSS limit per ADR-021; syscall-level isolation defers to v0.2 alongside plugin hash-pinning (NG-16).
- **Per-endpoint HTTP auth scoping**. v0.1 token is project-wide.
- **DB content-hash verification on load**. Malicious DB edit caught by the next `clarion analyze` (content hashes re-computed) but not at `clarion serve` boot time.
- **Automatic redaction** of secrets *within* files (v0.1 blocks the whole file; v0.2+ may replace secret substrings with `<redacted>` placeholders).
- **TLS on HTTP API**. Operators wanting network exposure run behind a reverse proxy terminating TLS.

### Audit surface

Every security-relevant event emits a finding:

- `CLA-SEC-SECRET-DETECTED` — unredacted secret blocked LLM dispatch
- `CLA-SEC-UNREDACTED-SECRETS-ALLOWED` — operator overrode block
- `CLA-INFRA-HTTP-AUTH-DISABLED` — `clarion serve` running with `serve.auth: none` (ADR-012); per-startup ERROR finding
- `CLA-INFRA-TOKEN-STORAGE-DEGRADED` — OS keychain unavailable
- `CLA-INFRA-BRIEFING-INVALID` — schema validation failed twice (possible injection)
- `CLA-SEC-VOCABULARY-CANDIDATE-NOVEL` — novel vocabulary tag proposed by LLM (light signal; mostly harmless)

Findings feed Filigree via the normal exchange. Security-focused operators can `filigree list --label=security --since 7d` across the suite.

### Operator guidance (non-code security)

Some risks sit outside Clarion's code but inside the operator's responsibility:

- **Use project-scoped API keys, not personal ones, when committing the DB**. Briefings in `.clarion/clarion.db` were paid for by whoever ran analyze; a teammate pulling your committed DB benefits from calls your personal key paid for. Use an Anthropic project key, not your personal key.
- **Rotate tokens when a committed DB exposes a stale model's output**. If the DB was generated with a leaked or exposed API key, the token is already used; briefings aren't themselves secret but the key's usage fingerprint is.
- **Review `.clarion/.gitignore` before first commit**. Default excludes `runs/*/log.jsonl` (raw LLM request/response bodies); opting in to commit logs ships source excerpts to the repo — a choice, not an oversight.

Operator-guidance documentation lives in the detailed-design §10 for procedural depth.

## 11. Suite Bootstrap

**Addresses**: REQ-INTEG-FILIGREE-05, NFR-RELIABILITY-02, NFR-OBSERV-04, CON-LOOM-01, CON-FILIGREE-02.

### What this section is

Clarion v0.1 is not joining an existing Loom fabric — it is the work that weaves the fabric for the v0.1 suite of Clarion + Filigree + Wardline. The integration reconnaissance (`2026-04-17-clarion-integration-recon.md`) verified that cross-tool surface area the Rev-1 design assumed is mostly not yet implemented: Wardline has no HTTP client, Filigree has no `registry_backend` flag or pluggable file registry, no cross-tool fixtures exist.

This section describes **Clarion's side** of the coordination: the capability-probe it runs at every analyse, the degraded modes it falls back into when sibling capabilities are absent, and what Clarion asks of sibling products as prerequisites. Per the Loom federation axiom ([../../suite/loom.md](../../suite/loom.md) §3, §6), there is **no central orchestrator** — each product handles its own integration surface, and sibling absence is a graceful degradation, not a failure.

### Capability negotiation at `clarion analyze` startup

Before Phase 0 (discovery + dry-run), Clarion probes each sibling and emits **exactly one** `CLA-INFRA-SUITE-COMPAT-REPORT` finding summarising the discovered state. One finding collapses scattered runtime surprises into a single auditable signal.

Probes:

1. **Filigree presence and version**: `GET <filigree_base_url>/api/files/_schema`. Record version, enums, flag presence.
2. **Filigree `registry_backend`**: look for the flag in `_schema.config_flags`. Absent → shadow-registry fallback.
3. **Filigree `/api/v1/observations`**: `HEAD` request. In v0.1 the absence is expected (MCP-spawn is the v0.1 path per ADR-016); presence signals v0.2 is installed and Clarion switches to HTTP.
4. **Wardline REGISTRY version**: `import wardline.core.registry; registry.REGISTRY_VERSION`. Compared against Clarion's pin.
5. **Wardline SARIF schema version**: read `wardline.sarif.baseline.json` header; check `wardline.propertyBagVersion`.

The `CLA-INFRA-SUITE-COMPAT-REPORT` carries `metadata.clarion.*` with every probe result — operators read one finding to understand how this run will behave.

### Per-component fallbacks

| Prerequisite not satisfied | Fallback mode | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Filigree unreachable entirely | Local-only: findings write to `runs/<run_id>/findings.jsonl`; no observations | `--no-filigree` explicit; `CLA-INFRA-FILIGREE-UNAVAILABLE` per batch |
| Filigree present; `registry_backend` absent | Shadow-registry: POSTs normally; Filigree auto-creates `file_records` under native rules | `CLA-INFRA-FILIGREE-SHADOW-REGISTRY` |
| `filigree` binary missing from `PATH` | Observation emission disabled; observations queued to `runs/<run_id>/deferred_observations.jsonl` for later replay | `CLA-INFRA-FILIGREE-BINARY-MISSING` |
| Wardline package not installable in plugin venv | Registry-mirror: hardcoded `wardline_registry_v<pin>.py` | `--no-wardline` explicit; `CLA-INFRA-WARDLINE-REGISTRY-MIRRORED` |
| Wardline installed; `REGISTRY_VERSION` additive-newer | Proceed with warning; additive decorators `clarion_augmentation` | `CLA-INFRA-WARDLINE-REGISTRY-ADDITIVE-SKEW` |
| Wardline installed; `REGISTRY_VERSION` major-bump or older | Mirror-mode | `CLA-INFRA-WARDLINE-REGISTRY-MIRRORED` |
| SARIF with unknown property-bag version | Best-effort translation; per-removed-key findings | `CLA-INFRA-SARIF-SCHEMA-UNKNOWN`, `CLA-INFRA-SARIF-KEY-REMOVED` |
| `clarion sarif import` not installed | Wardline findings don't reach Filigree via Clarion; operators use Wardline's existing SARIF→GitHub Security path | Manual — no auto-findings |

The degraded modes exist so Clarion ships on its own timeline, not the slowest of three. Per-run compat state is recorded in `runs/<run_id>/stats.json` so historical regressions in suite capability are visible.

### Prerequisites named here (full detail in detailed-design §11)

**Filigree side** (ADRs 014, 017 in detailed-design):
- `registry_backend` config flag + pluggable `RegistryProtocol` (the schema-surgery)
- `scan_source` coordination + schema-compat contract test + `metadata` nesting convention published

**Filigree-side nice-to-have (v0.2+)**:
- `POST /api/v1/observations` HTTP endpoint (ADR-016 — v0.1 uses MCP-spawn; endpoint retirement trigger)

**Wardline side** (ADRs 015, 018 in detailed-design):
- Stable `REGISTRY_VERSION` export + `LEGACY_DECORATOR_ALIASES` table
- YAML/JSON descriptor of REGISTRY (enables non-Python plugins — v0.2)
- Native `POST /api/v1/scan-results` emitter (v0.2; v0.1 uses Clarion-side SARIF translator)

**Joint**:
- Cross-tool test fixtures (mock Filigree server, Wardline SARIF corpus, schema-pin test)
- Three-tool coordinated release plan (belongs in the implementation plan, not this design)

### Why no central orchestrator

Per [../../suite/loom.md](../../suite/loom.md) §6, Loom does not own a coordination runtime. Capability negotiation is point-to-point — Clarion probes Filigree and Wardline directly, each sibling exposes its own surfaces, no "Loom bus" mediates. This section *is* that posture, expressed as Clarion's own behaviour.

If a future requirement emerged for "what if more tools join the suite and the probe matrix explodes?", the answer per the federation axiom is not "build a shared registry" — it is "each joining tool implements its own probe; each existing tool adds handling for it." That keeps the pairwise composition rule honest even as the suite grows.

## 12. Architecture Decisions

**Addresses**: canonical record of load-bearing design decisions. This table is the canonical home for ADR **status, priority, and rationale summaries**. Authored ADRs live as standalone files in [../adr/README.md](../adr/README.md). Backlog items remain summarised here until authored.

The parallel listing in [detailed-design.md §11](./detailed-design.md#11-architecture-decisions) is a narrower table carrying only "where captured in this design" for implementer navigation. It deliberately does not duplicate status, priority, or rationale — those live here.

### ADR summaries (P0 + P1)

| # | Decision | Status | Priority | Rationale summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ADR-001 | Rust for the core | Accepted | P0 | Primary author directive. Single-binary ship, mature ecosystem (axum/rusqlite/tokio), plugin interop via subprocess. Not subject to alternatives analysis. |
| ADR-002 | Plugin transport: Content-Length framed JSON-RPC 2.0 subprocess | Accepted | P0 | Binary-safe framing, resumability after crash, alignment with LSP patterns. Alternatives: newline-delimited JSON (unsafe for content with embedded newlines), Wasm (too early for plugin authoring ergonomics), embedded Python (couples core to Python runtime). |
| ADR-003 | Entity ID scheme: symbolic canonical-name; file path as property; EntityAlias v0.2 | Accepted | P0 | Cross-tool identity must survive file moves. Path-embedded IDs silently detach every reference; symbolic IDs survive 80% case (file move without rename). Rename tracking via EntityAlias deferred; manual `--repair-aliases` workaround in v0.1. |
| ADR-004 | Finding-exchange format: Filigree-native intake; `metadata.clarion.*` nesting | Accepted | P0 | Filigree's `POST /api/v1/scan-results` is production path; SARIF requires either translation or Filigree-side work. Nesting convention under `metadata` dict (verified verbatim preservation) avoids silent drops of extension fields. |
| ADR-005 | `.clarion/` git-committable by default; DB included, run logs excluded | To author | P1 | Shared-analysis-state story benefits small teams; run logs may contain source excerpts appropriate to Anthropic but not git. Default-exclude run logs via `.gitignore`; opt-in to commit. |
| [ADR-006](../adr/ADR-006-clustering-algorithm.md) | Clustering algorithm: Leiden (with Louvain fallback) on imports + calls subgraph | Accepted | P0 | Leiden's connected-community guarantee fixes Louvain's disconnected-cluster defect. Directed, weighted (reference_count); module-level. Louvain is the fallback selectable via config if Leiden implementation proves unstable. Modularity score recorded, not enforced (v0.1); hard threshold decision deferred to v0.2 pending Block C1 spike. |
| [ADR-007](../adr/ADR-007-summary-cache-key.md) | Summary cache key design: `(entity_id, content_hash, prompt_template_id, model_tier, guidance_fingerprint)` + TTL backstop + churn-eager invalidation | Accepted | P0 | Full 5-part key captures all syntactic staleness paths; TTL backstop (180d default) bounds semantic staleness the key alone doesn't see; churn-eager invalidation on `CLA-FACT-GUIDANCE-CHURN-STALE` makes stale-guidance pressure visible via cost. Neighborhood-drift flag (`stale_semantic: true`) rather than forced miss preserves NFR-COST-02's 95% hit-rate target. Block C1 spike validates the assumption. |
| ADR-008 | (Superseded by ADR-014.) | Superseded | — | Initial Filigree file-registry displacement design was "feature flag"; recon showed it's schema surgery. See ADR-014. |
| ADR-009 | Structured briefings vs free-form prose | To author | P2 | Principle 2 requires bounded, composable responses; prose is neither. Schema validation also enables prompt-injection detection (schema-invalid → possible injection). |
| ADR-010 | MCP as first-class surface — lock-in cost vs ecosystem reach | To author | P2 | Anthropic's MCP standard is the ecosystem's current centre of gravity for LLM tool integrations; lock-in cost is acknowledged but the ecosystem reach outweighs it for v0.1. Strategic review at v0.3+. |
| [ADR-011](../adr/ADR-011-writer-actor-concurrency.md) | Writer-actor concurrency model (vs shadow-DB swap) | Accepted | P0 | Single writer actor + per-N-files transactions (default N=50) is the committed shape; `--shadow-db` opt-in for zero-stale-read scenarios. Design-review §2.2 CRITICAL flag retires. SQLite-concurrency-under-load assumption named as v0.2 validation task (`NG-28` proposed). |
| [ADR-012](../adr/ADR-012-http-auth-default.md) | HTTP read-API auth: UDS default with TCP+token fallback | Accepted | P0 | v0.1 default is Unix domain socket (`.clarion/socket` mode 0600); Windows / cross-UID-namespace / SSH-forwarded cases fall back to TCP + auto-minted Bearer token. `serve.auth: none` emits `CLA-INFRA-HTTP-AUTH-DISABLED` ERROR per serve startup. Closes T-02 (risk 9) and structurally reduces T-05 in the primary path. Panel "three non-negotiable v0.1 controls" rec 1. |
| [ADR-013](../adr/ADR-013-pre-ingest-secret-scanner.md) | Pre-ingest secret scanner with LLM-dispatch block | Accepted | P0 | Rust-native port of detect-secrets rule set (preserves NFR-OPS-04 single-binary). File-level block on detection; structural extraction preserved; briefings marked `briefing_blocked: secret_present`. `.clarion/secrets-baseline.yaml` for false-positives. `--allow-unredacted-secrets` requires TTY confirm OR explicit `--confirm-allow-unredacted-secrets=yes-i-understand` in CI. |
| [ADR-014](../adr/ADR-014-filigree-registry-backend.md) | Filigree `registry_backend` flag + pluggable `RegistryProtocol` — schema surgery, not config flip | Accepted | P0 | Four NOT-NULL foreign keys on `file_records(id)` + three auto-create paths require a real interface, not a flag. Clarion's shadow-registry fallback preserves v0.1 shipability when Filigree hasn't landed the surgery. |
| [ADR-015](../adr/ADR-015-wardline-filigree-emission.md) | Wardline→Filigree emission ownership: Clarion-side SARIF translator (v0.1), native Wardline POST (v0.2) | Accepted | P0 | Wardline has no HTTP client today (`integration-recon:339`); adding one is a refactor not on the v0.1 timeline. Clarion-side translator ships independently; translator stays permanent for Semgrep / CodeQL / etc. `loom.md` §5 asterisk 1 retires when native emitter lands. Revision trigger: Block C2 spike showing emitter is ≤1 day of work promotes to v0.1. |
| [ADR-016](../adr/ADR-016-observation-transport.md) | Observation transport: `filigree mcp` subprocess spawn (v0.1); `POST /api/v1/observations` HTTP (v0.2) | Accepted | P0 | Per Q1 scope commitment, observation HTTP transport deferred to v0.2. v0.1 emits via Clarion spawning `filigree mcp` subprocess and calling existing `create_observation` MCP tool over stdio. v0.2 HTTP endpoint is the retirement trigger; capability probe detects via `HEAD /api/v1/observations`. |
| [ADR-017](../adr/ADR-017-severity-and-dedup.md) | Severity mapping + rule-ID round-trip + dedup via `mark_unseen=true` | Accepted | P0 | Clarion internal severity (`INFO/WARN/ERROR/CRITICAL`) maps to Filigree wire (`critical/high/medium/low/info`). Round-trip preserves internal via `metadata.clarion.internal_severity`. `mark_unseen=true` is the v0.1 dedup workaround for entities moving within files; server-side per-entity dedup deferred to v0.2 (NG-21). Fixes `CLA-INFRA-PARSE-ERROR` vs `CLA-PY-PARSE-ERROR` drift (Issue 7). |
| [ADR-018](../adr/ADR-018-identity-reconciliation.md) | Identity reconciliation: Clarion maintains translation layer; Wardline owns its qualnames; direct REGISTRY import with version pinning | Accepted | P0 | Three identity schemes exist (Clarion EntityId, Wardline qualname, exception-register location). Clarion is the translator — it owns the catalog that makes the qualnames meaningful. Forcing Wardline to adopt Clarion's scheme would be centralisation drift (loom.md §6). Plugin-level REGISTRY import is a named initialization-coupling asterisk (loom.md §5) retiring when Wardline publishes a YAML/JSON descriptor (NG-25, v0.2). |
| ADR-019 | SARIF property-bag preservation: Wardline's 44 `wardline.*` extension keys round-trip through `metadata.wardline_properties.*` | To author | P1 | Filigree preserves `metadata` verbatim. Literal pass-through handles Wardline's extensive extension keys; unknown schema versions use best-effort mapping with per-removed-key findings. |
| ADR-020 | Degraded-mode policy: Clarion ships on its own timeline; `--no-filigree` / `--no-wardline` explicit flags | To author | P1 | Per `CON-LOOM-01`, sibling absence reduces Clarion's capability but must not alter its semantics. Explicit flags name the degradation; the compat probe report makes per-run state auditable. |
| [ADR-021](../adr/ADR-021-plugin-authority-hybrid.md) | Plugin authority model: hybrid — plugin declares capabilities in manifest, core enforces minimum-safe controls (path jail, Content-Length ceiling, entity-count cap, per-plugin `prlimit` RSS) | Accepted | P0 | The design currently assumes "trusted extension" but ships to a security-conscious audience that will assume "validated input". Full sandbox is over-investment for a single first-party plugin; trusted-extension default leaves four threats open (T-01, T-08, T-11, T-12 per panel `09-threat-model.md` §7). Hybrid closes T-08/T-11/T-12 and raises the floor on T-01 at tractable v0.1 cost. |
| [ADR-022](../adr/ADR-022-core-plugin-ontology.md) | Core/plugin ontology ownership boundary: plugins declare entity kinds and edge kinds; core validates shape without embedding ontology | Accepted | P0 | Principle 3 requires "plugin owns ontology; core owns algorithms" but the data-layer analogue at the core/plugin boundary was unstated. Plugins own kind vocabulary for language-specific concepts; the core validates shape (identifier grammar, reserved-kind namespace, rule-ID namespacing, emission-declaration contract) without baking in Python-specific assumptions. Shapes ADR-002's RPC surface, ADR-003's `{kind}` ID component, and ADR-006's clustering subgraph. |

### Writing cadence

ADR-001 through ADR-004, ADR-006, ADR-007, ADR-011, ADR-012, ADR-013, ADR-014, ADR-015, ADR-016, ADR-017, ADR-018, ADR-021, and ADR-022 are authored and Accepted as standalone files in [../adr/](../adr/README.md). The remaining backlog items are ADR-005, ADR-009, ADR-010, ADR-019, and ADR-020; they stay summarised here and in the ADR index until the code that depends on them is ready to land. Any decision reversal during implementation (e.g., "writer-actor doesn't work; switching to shadow-DB") requires a new dated ADR revision, not an edit to the original.

Authored ADR text (context, decision, alternatives considered, consequences, status) lives in [../adr/README.md](../adr/README.md). These summaries are the navigation aid; the canonical record of completed decisions is the ADR collection itself.

## Glossary

The terms below are the ones this system-design layer relies on most heavily:

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Briefing** | Structured summary answering a fixed set of questions about an entity. |
| **Entity** | Typed node in Clarion's property graph. |
| **Entity ID** | Stable identifier of the form `{plugin_id}:{kind}:{canonical_qualified_name}`. |
| **Edge** | Typed relationship between entities such as `contains`, `calls`, or `imports`. |
| **Finding** | Structured claim-with-evidence; may be a defect, fact, classification, metric, or suggestion. |
| **Guidance fingerprint** | Hash of the guidance sheets applied to a query; part of the summary-cache key. |
| **Plugin manifest** | YAML declaration of a plugin's kinds, edges, rules, and capabilities. |
| **Scope lens** | Query/session filter that biases neighbour lookups toward a relationship family. |
| **Tier** | Wardline trust classification preserved verbatim by Clarion. |
| **Writer-actor** | Single task that owns SQLite writes; other tasks submit mutations through it. |
| **Pre-ingest redaction** | Secret scan that runs before any file content is sent to the LLM provider. |
| **Capability probe / compat report** | Startup check of sibling-tool availability that emits one compatibility finding. |
| **`scan_run_id`** | Filigree-owned identifier for a finding-emission run. |

See [detailed-design.md](./detailed-design.md) Appendix B for the full glossary.
