"""Project-interpreter discovery for pyright (clarion-5cf9643de9).

``pyright-langserver`` decides which Python environment to type-check against
by running whatever ``python`` is first on its ``PATH`` unless the client sets
``python.pythonPath``. Under ``loomweave analyze`` launched from an agent hook
that ``python`` is the system interpreter, which cannot import the project's
editable install, and every ``tests/`` -> ``src/`` call target came back empty
while the coverage claim still said ``complete``. This module picks an
operator- or environment-selected interpreter deterministically so the answer
no longer depends on who launched the run. Repository-owned .venv paths are
deliberately not auto-selected because Pyright executes pythonPath during
analysis.

The order below is a CROSS-LANGUAGE CONTRACT with
``crates/loomweave-core/src/plugin/interpreter.rs`` (the host runs the same
discovery, exports the winner as ``LOOMWEAVE_PYTHON_INTERPRETER``, and keys the
incremental skip on it). Change both or neither.

Paths are returned as absolute and lexically normalised (``Path.absolute`` +
``os.path.normpath``): ``.``/``..`` collapsed, symlinks preserved. A venv's
``bin/python`` is typically a symlink to the base interpreter; handing pyright
the symlink path keeps it within the project's venv site-packages, while
resolving to the realpath would escape to the base interpreter's site-packages.
